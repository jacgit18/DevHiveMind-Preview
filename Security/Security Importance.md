Security is an important topic in the field of software engineering. There are many different aspects to security. You can secure communications with encryption or TLS. You can prevent network intrusion with firewall rules and proper network configuration. You can study common software vulnerabilities and protect against denial of service attacks. As a software engineer, it is important to be familiar with the different types of security risks and how to mitigate them.

One type of security risk is a man-in-the-middle attack. This is where an attacker intercepts communication between two parties and tries to eavesdrop or modify the data being exchanged. To prevent this type of attack, it is important to encrypt and authenticate the communicated parties using Transport Layer Security (TLS).

Another type of security risk is a denial of service attack. This is where an attacker tries to prevent legitimate users from accessing a service by flooding it with requests or through finding a way to crash the backend by sending a special payload. To prevent this type of attack, it is important to have a firewall or a layer 7 DDOS protection layer in place to block illegitimate requests. Cloudflare has great services to detect DDOS traffic. This is of course made possible through layer 7 inspection.

Of course its hard to summarize all possible security attacks. There is a client side security attacks such as XSS (cross side scripting), there are server side security attacks such as SQL injection.

Another skill that a backend developerÂ **needs to have is ensuring the security of their backend code and data**. Security is the process of protecting the backend code and data from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. It is essential for backend development because it ensures the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the backend code and data.

Security involves various aspects such as:

- Authentication: Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or a component that tries to access the backend code or data. It usually involves providing credentials such as username and password, tokens, certificates, etc.
- Authorization: Authorization is the process of granting or denying access rights to the backend code or data based on the identity and role of a user or a component. It usually involves defining policies and rules that specify what actions can be performed by whom on what resources.
- Encryption: Encryption is the process of transforming the backend code or data into an unreadable form using an algorithm and a key. It usually involves encrypting data at rest (in storage) or in transit (in communication) to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
- Hashing: Hashing is the process of generating a fixed-length string from the backend code or data using an algorithm. It usually involves hashing passwords or other sensitive data to prevent storing them in plain text or comparing them without revealing them.
- Logging: Logging is the process of recording the events and activities that occur in the backend code or data. It usually involves creating log files or records that contain information such as date, time, source, destination, action, outcome, etc.
- Auditing: Auditing is the process of reviewing and analyzing the logs and records that are created by the logging process. It usually involves checking for anomalies, errors, violations or breaches in the backend code or data.

A backend developer needs to use various security tools and techniques to implement these aspects in their backend code and data. Some examples of security tools and techniques are:

- JSON Web Tokens (JWT): JWT are an open standard for creating and verifying tokens that contain claims or information about a user or a component. They can be used for authentication and authorization purposes in RESTful APIs.
- SSL/TLS: SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are protocols that provide encryption and authentication for data in transit. They can be used to secure the communication between the backend and the frontend or other components using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure).
- bcrypt: bcrypt is a hashing algorithm that is designed to be slow and resistant to brute-force attacks. It can be used to hash passwords or other sensitive data before storing them in a database or comparing them for verification.
- Log4j: Log4j is a logging framework that provides features and functionalities to create and manage log files or records. It can be used to log the events and activities that occur in the backend code or data.
- ELK Stack: ELK Stack is a combination of three open source tools: Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana. Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine that stores and indexes log data. Logstash is a data processing pipeline that collects, parses and transforms log data. Kibana is a visualization and dashboard tool that displays and analyzes log data. ELK Stack can be used to audit the logs and records that are created by the logging process.
