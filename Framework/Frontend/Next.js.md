Next.js is a React-based web framework that simplifies the development of web applications by providing a structured and opinionated approach. It solves several challenges faced in traditional React applications, such as server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and easy client-side navigation.

By offering server-side rendering, Next.js enhances performance and [[SEO]], as it generates HTML on the server instead of relying solely on client-side rendering. Automatic code splitting ensures that only the necessary JavaScript is sent to the browser, optimizing page load times. Additionally, Next.js facilitates client-side navigation through its built-in routing system, streamlining the development of single-page applications.

In essence, Next.js aims to make React applications more efficient, scalable, and SEO-friendly, addressing common pain points in web development.

Next.js also includes built-in support for Internationalization (i18n), making it easier for developers to create multilingual web applications. The i18n support in Next.js provides a convenient way to handle translations and adapt content for different languages.

With Next.js's i18n features, developers can easily configure language-specific routing, format dates and numbers based on locale, and manage translations through various plugins or libraries. This built-in support simplifies the process of creating web applications that cater to a global audience by handling language-specific content and user experiences seamlessly.
