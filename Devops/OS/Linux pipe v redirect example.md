Both of these commands are used to append a line of text to the `/etc/hosts` file in Linux, but they achieve this in different ways. Here's the difference between the two commands:

1. `sudo "echo 8.8.8.8 google" >> /etc/hosts`:

   This command attempts to run the entire string `"echo 8.8.8.8 google"` with elevated privileges using `sudo`. However, this is not the correct way to use `sudo` for this purpose. `sudo` is usually used to execute a specific command as a superuser, not to run a string as a command itself.

   What happens in this case is that `sudo` treats the entire quoted string as a single command and tries to find an executable file with that name, which doesn't exist. Consequently, you'll likely encounter an error like this:

   ```
   sudo: echo 8.8.8.8 google: command not found
   ```

   In this case, `sudo` doesn't interpret the `>> /etc/hosts` part because it's outside the quotes. As a result, the redirection (`>>`) is performed without elevated privileges, and you might not have the necessary permissions to write to `/etc/hosts`.

2. `"echo 8.8.8.8 google" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`:

   This command correctly uses `sudo` to run the `tee` command as a superuser, and `tee` is used to append data to the `/etc/hosts` file. Here's how it works:

   - `"echo 8.8.8.8 google"`: This part generates the text to be appended.
   - `|` (Pipe): It pipes the output of the `echo` command as input to `sudo tee`.
   - `sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`: This part runs the `tee` command with elevated privileges (`sudo`) and appends the piped input to the `/etc/hosts` file (`-a` flag means "append").

   With this approach, the text is appended to the `/etc/hosts` file with the necessary superuser privileges granted by `sudo`. It correctly appends the specified text to the file without any issues.

In summary, the second command `"echo 8.8.8.8 google" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts` is the correct and recommended way to append text to a system file like `/etc/hosts` using `sudo`. The first command attempts to use `sudo` in an incorrect manner and will likely result in an error.
