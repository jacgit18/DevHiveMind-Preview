## home

- Each user has its own /home folder.
- Storage of your personal files and documents.
- Each user can only access their own /home folder unless they use admin permissions.
- It has some hidden directories that start with a dot. e.g. .cache, .config. These hidden folders are used by different applications for their settings. You can see them by using the ls -a command in the terminal.
- You can back up the hidden directories and restore them in a new system. After reinstalling your applications, the settings will be restored.
