### Continuous Integration & Deployment

CI, strictly defined, involves frequently merging developer changes into the main branch, often "several times a day." While CI encompasses steps like linting, building, testing, packaging, and deployment, the industry often focuses on what occurs post-merge.

In practical CI, the process may deviate from strict definitions to foster development speed and creativity. A robust CI system, such as GitHub Actions, automates these steps seamlessly, maintaining the integrity of development workflows.

While deployment isn't inherently part of the CI process, real-world scenarios demand considerations. Testing packages during CI ensures code integrity, even if deployment actions are deferred. The deployment process should ideally remain consistent across different branches, promoting efficiency and reliability.

#### Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment  

The terms **Continuous Delivery** and **Continuous Deployment** (CD) describe CI practices that extend to deployments. CD ensures the main branch is deployable continuously, often coupled with automated deployments triggered by merges into the main branch.

The line between CI and CD can blur. For instance, tests ensuring the main branch's deployability can be seen as both CI (frequent merges) and CD (deployability assurance).

The terms **CI** and **CI/CD** are often used interchangeably, acknowledging the interconnected nature of these practices.

#### **Types of CI Setups**

To meet CI/CD requirements, a dedicated server for running tasks minimizes unpredictability risks. Two options exist: hosting a self-owned server or utilizing a cloud service.

1. **Jenkins (Self-hosted):**
   - Pros: Flexibility, control, extensive plugin support.
   - Cons: Complexity in setup, potential for boilerplate code, hardware failure risks.

2. **[[GitHub Actions]] and Cloud-based Solutions:**
   - Pros: Simplified setup, no environment worries, easy configuration.
   - Cons: Limited customization for complex tasks, resource constraints, build time billing.

**Choosing Between Self-hosted and Cloud-based Solutions**

- **Cloud-based Solutions:** Ideal for small to medium projects with standard requirements. Simplicity in configuration, cost-effectiveness, and no need for an elaborate setup make it suitable for smaller projects.

- **Self-hosted CI:** Preferable for larger projects with specific resource needs. More control over resources and suitability for extensive projects and teams make it a choice for larger enterprises.
