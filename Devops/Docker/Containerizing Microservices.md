Containerizing microservices in JavaScript typically involves using Docker to create container images for each microservice and then possibly using a tool like Docker Compose to manage and orchestrate these containers. Below is a simplified example of how you might structure the setup:  
  
1. **Create Dockerfile for Each Microservice:**  
For each microservice, create a Dockerfile. Here's a basic example for a Node.js service:  
  
```dockerfile  
# Dockerfile for a Node.js microservice  
FROM node:14  
  
WORKDIR /usr/src/app  
  
COPY package*.json ./  
  
RUN npm install  
  
COPY . .  
  
EXPOSE 3000  
  
CMD ["npm", "start"]  
```  
  
Customize this based on your specific project structure and dependencies.  
  
2. **Build Docker Images:**  
Build the Docker images for each microservice using the respective Dockerfile. Replace `service1` and `service2` with your actual service names.  
  
```bash  
docker build -t service1:latest ./path/to/service1  
docker build -t service2:latest ./path/to/service2  
```  
  
3. **Create Docker Compose File:**  
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and manage the services:  
  
```yaml  
version: '3'  
services:  
service1:  
image: service1:latest  
ports:  
- "3001:3000"  
networks:  
- my-network  
  
service2:  
image: service2:latest  
ports:  
- "3002:3000"  
networks:  
- my-network  
  
networks:  
my-network:  
driver: bridge  
```  
  
Customize the ports and service names as needed.  
  
4. **Run Docker Compose:**  
Start your microservices using Docker Compose:  
  
```bash  
docker-compose up  
```  
  
This will start your services in separate containers, and they can communicate with each other if needed.  
  
Remember, this is a basic example, and your actual setup may vary based on your project requirements, dependencies, and deployment environment. Also, ensure that your services can discover and communicate with each other based on your application architecture.
