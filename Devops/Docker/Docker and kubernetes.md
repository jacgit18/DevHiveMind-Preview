[[Docker InDeph.canvas|Docker]] and Kubernetes are versatile tools capable of handling both stateless and stateful applications.

- **Stateless Applications:**
  - Stateless applications don't need to retain any information.
  - They operate independently of previous interactions, making them easily scalable and resilient.
  - Docker and Kubernetes efficiently manage the deployment and scaling of stateless applications.

- **Stateful Applications:**
  - Stateful applications need to remember information, whether stored in a database or variables within the code base.
  - Docker and Kubernetes provide mechanisms like persistent volumes to manage stateful data.
  - StatefulSets in Kubernetes are specifically designed to handle stateful workloads, ensuring stable network identities and persistent storage.

In summary, Docker and Kubernetes offer a comprehensive solution for deploying and managing both stateless and stateful applications, addressing the diverse requirements of modern software architectures.
