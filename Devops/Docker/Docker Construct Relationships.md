- Docker Images and Containers: Docker images serve as blueprints for creating containers. Containers are instantiated from Docker images. Each container runs an instance of an image, allowing you to run multiple instances of the same application with isolated environments.  
  
- Containers and Volumes: Containers can be configured to use volumes to store and manage persistent data. This decouples the data from the container itself, allowing the data to survive container restarts or updates.  
  
- Docker Images and [[Docker Volumes]]: Docker images do not typically interact directly with volumes. Images define the application and its dependencies, while volumes store persistent data. However, images can be designed to include pre-configured data, which can then be used when a container is launched.  
  
In summary, Docker images define what a software application consists of, containers are the running instances of those images that provide isolation, and volumes are used to manage and persist data between containers. These concepts work together to facilitate consistent, portable, and efficient application deployment and management.
