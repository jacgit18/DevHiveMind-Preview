GitHub Actions operate on the foundation of workflows, which are sequences of jobs triggered by specific events. These jobs contain explicit instructions for GitHub Actions to execute. Typically, a workflow unfolds as follows:

1. A triggering event occurs, such as a push to the main branch.
2. The associated workflow is executed.
3. Cleanup processes are undertaken.

For effective Continuous Integration (CI) in a repository, several basic requirements must be met:

- The existence of a repository.
- Specification of CI tasks, either within the repository or defined in the CI system.
- Awareness of the repository and its content by the CI.
- Accessible permissions for the CI to interact with the repository.
- Necessary credentials for the CI to perform designated actions, such as deploying to a production environment.

GitHub Actions present a notable advantage over self-hosted solutions because both the repository and the CI platform are hosted by GitHub. This integration streamlines the process, as GitHub is already cognizant of defined workflows and their configurations when Actions are enabled for a repository.
