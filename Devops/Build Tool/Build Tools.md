***Maven*** and ***Gradle*** belong to the realm of [[build]] tools, serving to automate the process of transforming application source code into publishable artifacts.

In the JavaScript ecosystem, analogous tools include ***Yarn, NPM, PNPM, webpack bundler, gulp, babel, parcel, browserify, grunt, or requireJS.*** The term "build" corresponds to a diverse set of tools and processes, with the outfolder serving as a build folder for code execution in IntelliJ.

In JavaScript, a bundler serves as the equivalent of a build tool. The meaning of "build" varies across languages; for interpreted languages like Python or Ruby, a build step may not be necessary. Generally, building involves preparing software to run on its intended platform. For instance, transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript in the case of a Node application or compiling code into an executable for languages like C and Rust.

Webpack, as explored in part 7, stands as the predominant tool for building production versions of React or other frontend JavaScript/TypeScript codebases. Its role encompasses complex tasks crucial for preparing code for deployment in a production environment.

## Build and Deployment Process Clarification

The term "Build" encompasses the comprehensive process, including compilation, where the compiler translates source code into object files linked by the linker, forming an executable application or library. Building involves multiple steps like pre-processing, compiling, linking, data file conversion, automated testing, and packaging, preparing an application for release.

### Compile:

- A specific term referring to using a compiler to convert high-level source code into an object file.
- Part of the broader build process.
- Executed whenever the compiler translates programming language code into machine code.

An artifact, the outcome of the build process, can be an archive file or a directory structure. It includes compilation output, libraries from module dependencies, and resource collections.

While developers could manually perform these tasks, build tools like Maven and Gradle automate processes such as compilation, packaging, and artifact publication, streamlining software development.

Modern applications' demands have extended Maven and Gradle's functionalities beyond basic building. They now handle tasks like local application execution, test verification, code analysis, and more.

### Maven vs. Gradle Performance Comparison:

Gradle has introduced performance optimizations, addressing gaps in Maven's capabilities. A comparison of Maven vs. Gradle performance considers scenarios like:

1. **Clean, then Full Build with Tests:**
   - Simulates a build on fresh code checkout or CI server.

2. **Build with Tests Without Clean:**
   - Simulates a rebuild with no changes.

3. **Small Code Change, Then Build with Tests:**
   - Simulates a rebuild after a developer makes a change.

Testing was conducted across two project types, and an average of three results was considered for each scenario. In instances where the Gradle `build` task is mentioned, Maven's `package` phase was used for comparison. This performance analysis helps gauge the efficiency of Maven and Gradle in different build scenarios.


### Small Java project 
10 subprojects each with 50 main classes and 50 test classes. 1,000 class total.

### Medium Java project
100 subprojects each with 100 main classes and 100 test classes. 20,000 class total.

Both Maven and Gradle necessitate a build file for project configuration. Below, the Maven's pom.xml and Gradle's Groovy build.gradle for a simple Java Spring Boot application are compared.

### Maven's pom.xml:
```xml
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-app</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
  
  <parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.6.1</version>
  </parent>
  
  <!-- Dependencies, plugins, and configurations -->
</project>
```

### Gradle's build.gradle:
```groovy
plugins {
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.6.1'
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.0.11.RELEASE'
}

group = 'com.example'
version = '1.0.0'
  
dependencies {
    // Dependencies declaration
}

// Additional configurations
```

Maven's pom.xml is 62 lines, nearly twice the length of the 35-line build.gradle. This discrepancy is mainly due to XML verbosity. The more concise build.gradle is often considered easier to read and maintain. For instance, a Gradle pull request to add a new dependency is a 1-line change compared to Maven's 4-line change.

## Maven vs. Gradle Usability Comparison:

- **Local Installation:** Maven requires a local installation, while Gradle utilizes its wrapper script, enabling immediate project building without installing Gradle. This simplicity extends to CI servers.

- **Build Execution:** To run a Maven build, a phase is passed to the Maven command (e.g., `mvn package`). In Gradle, a task is passed to the Gradle wrapper (e.g., `./gradlew build`).

- **Artifact Output:** Maven creates build artifacts within a `target` directory, whereas Gradle utilizes a `build` directory.

This usability comparison highlights Gradle's convenience with its wrapper script, succinct syntax, and streamlined processes for project building and dependency management.

The console output for Maven shows all info level log statements and test output. Gradle has a dynamic console, which shows only the task it’s currently working on with a final success/failure message.

Which console is better is subjective, but some may find Gradle’s console easier to read as it’s more concise. If detailed output is needed, you can enable it via the command line options.

When seeking ongoing support with Maven, finding the right avenues may not be straightforward. Issues cannot be raised directly on the GitHub repository, and the Slack channel is exclusively for contributors.

In contrast, Gradle offers multiple support options. Questions can be asked on the Gradle forum, the Gradle community Slack channel is open for inquiries, and issues can be raised directly on the Gradle repository. Additionally, debugging Gradle build scripts can be done seamlessly from your IDE, providing a hands-on approach to solving issues independently. This robust support infrastructure enhances the user experience and troubleshooting capabilities within the Gradle ecosystem.

## Maven vs. Gradle Customization Insights

Once your project is configured for compilation and testing, both Maven and Gradle offer plugins for additional functionality, such as static code analysis and test code coverage calculation. However, when it comes to further customization, the approaches differ.

### Customization Levels:

**Maven:**
- **Option:** Write your own plugin.
- **Process:** Involves creating a separate project and publishing the plugin artifact for use in any project.

**Gradle:**
1. **Build Script:** Define tasks, methods, and classes within the build script.
2. **Project:** Place code in the special `buildSrc` directory for reuse across multiple subprojects.
3. **Cross-Project:** Create a separate project and publish a reusable plugin, similar to Maven.

### Customization Example:

Gradle's dynamic build model and build script flexibility enable extensive customization. For instance, a Gradle build script can easily register a task to print the dependency count:

```groovy
tasks.register('countDependencies') {
    doLast { 
        println "Dependency count: ${configurations.getByName('compileClasspath').getAllDependencies().size()}"
    }
}
```

Running this task produces the following output:

```bash
$ ./gradlew countDependencies 
> Task :countDependencies 
> Dependency count: 6 BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s 
> 1 actionable task: 1 executed
```

Achieving similar custom behavior in Maven necessitates creating an entirely separate project. This ability to reuse build logic efficiently in Gradle reduces duplication and enhances maintainability, particularly in larger multi-module projects.

### Multi-Module Projects:

Both Maven and Gradle support multi-module projects. In Maven, sub-modules are defined in the `pom.xml` build file, while in Gradle, they are specified in the `settings.gradle` file.

## Maven vs. Gradle Usability:

**Maven:**
- Support avenues for issues are less apparent.
- Requires a local Maven installation.
- Build execution involves passing a phase to the Maven command (e.g., `mvn package`).
- Creates build artifacts within a `target` directory.

**Gradle:**
- Offers multiple support options, including forums, Slack, and direct repository issues.
- Utilizes the Gradle wrapper, allowing immediate project building without local installation.
- Build execution involves passing a task to the Gradle wrapper (e.g., `./gradlew build`).
- Utilizes a `build` directory for build artifacts.

This usability comparison emphasizes Gradle's user-friendly support options, wrapper script convenience, and succinct syntax for improved project building and customization. Gradle is recommended for new projects due to its speed, conciseness, ease of customization, and improved developer experience. For Maven to Gradle migration, considerations include resourcing, timeline, and future-proofing, with Gradle being favored for its popularity, active development, and modern features. The experience of the Spring Boot team highlights the success and significant time savings achieved through a migration to Gradle.
