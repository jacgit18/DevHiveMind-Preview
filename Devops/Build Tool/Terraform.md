Terraform operates as a powerful Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, facilitating the seamless management and provisioning of infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. In the realm of Terraform code, there exists a distinctive syntax employed for interfacing with and defining/configuring services from various cloud providers. This approach involves crafting configuration files that succinctly encapsulate infrastructure specifications, enhancing the ease of configuration editing and distribution.
