Gradle employs a domain-specific language (DSL) rather than XML, a departure from Maven's XML-centric approach. There are tools available to convert Gradle to Maven and vice versa, translating between Gradle build files and Maven's pom XML.

**Gradle Overview:**
- Created in 2008 to address Maven's limitations.
- Utilizes a Groovy-based DSL for build scripts, enhancing readability and conciseness.
- Offers a customizable build model directly from the script, allowing dynamic addition of custom build logic.

**Gradle's Build Lifecycle:**
- Introduces an incremental build feature for faster application building, particularly advantageous for minor code changes.

**Gradle Java Plugin:**
- Enhances flexibility with a code-based build script, replacing Maven's XML verbosity.
- Supports easy customization of the build model within the script itself.

**Creating a Build Scan in Gradle:**
- Gradle allows the creation of build scans to analyze and optimize builds.

**Choosing Gradle Over Maven or Ant:**
- Gradle combines Ant's flexibility with Maven's convention over configuration.
- Implements efficient input and output checks for incremental builds, resulting in faster build times.
- Utilizes Groovy, a DSL known for its readability and ease of use.

**Equivalent of Pom.xml in Gradle:**
- The equivalent to Maven's pom.xml in Gradle is the build.gradle script. It defines project configurations in Groovy or Kotlin.

**Difference Between Gradle Build.gradle and Maven build.xml:**
- Gradle's build.gradle script is code-based, leveraging a DSL for conciseness.
- Maven's build.xml script, in contrast, is XML-centric and may require separate plugins for customizations.

Hans Dockter, Gradle's founder, envisioned a modern build tool with a code-based build script, incremental builds, and an easily customizable build model, addressing Maven's limitations and contributing to improved performance.

Gradle operates within the JVM and natively supports building Java, Groovy, Scala, and even C++ applications. Third-party plugins extend its capabilities to languages like Kotlin.

The flexibility of Gradle allows developers to choose between writing build scripts in Groovy or Kotlin, both sharing numerous similarities. These build scripts encompass essential configurations such as project details, applied plugins, and application dependencies.

In Gradle, a "task" represents a unit of work in the build process, equivalent to a Maven goal. Interacting with Gradle is facilitated through the Gradle CLI. For instance, executing `./gradlew test` triggers tasks like compiling code (`classes`), compiling test code (`testClasses`), and running tests (`test`).

Gradle organizes tasks in a task graph, enabling task dependencies. It ensures each task executes at most once, optimizing build efficiency by skipping tasks previously executed in unchanged conditions.

As an open-source tool distributed under the Apache License, Gradle is free to use. Gradle Inc. maintains it and offers additional products and services through their paid Gradle Enterprise service.

## Project Structure:

Unlike Maven, Gradle necessitates additional files and directories in your repository:

1. **gradle directory:** Contains wrapper code and properties, crucial for the Gradle wrapper.
2. **gradlew & gradlew.bat scripts:** Facilitate running a Gradle build via the wrapper.
3. **settings.gradle:** Holds extra project settings like the project name.

This structure enhances Gradle's functionality and aligns with its philosophy of providing a customizable and efficient build system.
