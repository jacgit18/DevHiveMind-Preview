Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern commonly used in software development to manage the dependencies between components of a system. DI helps improve the modularity, testability, and maintainability of software by decoupling components and making them more independent.

A dependency injector is a component or framework that facilitates the process of managing and resolving dependencies in a software system. It provides mechanisms to automatically instantiate and inject dependencies into classes, relieving developers from manually wiring dependencies together.

### A dependency injector typically follows a set of principles:

- Dependency Registration: The injector allows developers to register dependencies by associating them with their corresponding interfaces or classes.

- Dependency Resolution: When a class requests a dependency, the injector resolves it by looking up the registered dependencies based on their associated interfaces or classes.

- Dependency Injection: The injector automatically injects the resolved dependencies into the requesting class, either through constructor injection, setter injection, or other injection methods.


### Three commonly  used models or approaches to implementing dependency injection:

1. Constructor Injection: Constructor injection involves passing dependencies to a class through its constructor. The class declares its dependencies as constructor parameters, and the caller is responsible for providing those dependencies when creating an instance of the class. Here's an example in Java:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private Dependency dependency;

    public MyClass(Dependency dependency) {
        this.dependency = dependency;
    }

    // ...
}

```

The caller would instantiate `MyClass` and provide the necessary `Dependency` object. This way, the class doesn't need to know how to create its dependencies, making it more flexible and reusable.
    
2. Setter Injection: Setter injection involves setting dependencies on a class through setter methods. Instead of passing dependencies through the constructor, the class provides setter methods for each dependency, and the caller sets the required dependencies after creating an instance. Here's an example:


```java
public class MyClass {
    private Dependency dependency;

    public void setDependency(Dependency dependency) {
        this.dependency = dependency;
    }

    // ...
}

```

 The caller would create an instance of `MyClass` and call the `setDependency` method to provide the required `Dependency` object. Setter injection is useful when you have optional dependencies or need to change dependencies at runtime.
    
3. Interface Injection: Interface injection involves using interfaces to provide dependencies to a class. The class declares an interface that defines methods for injecting dependencies, and the caller implements that interface to provide the dependencies. This approach allows for more flexibility in the choice of dependencies. Here's an example:

```java
public interface DependencyInjector {
    void injectDependency(Dependency dependency);
}

public class MyClass implements DependencyInjector {
    private Dependency dependency;

    public void injectDependency(Dependency dependency) {
        this.dependency = dependency;
    }

    // ...
}

```

The caller would implement the `DependencyInjector` interface and pass an instance of it to `MyClass`. Then, `MyClass` can call the `injectDependency` method to receive the necessary `Dependency` object.
    


4. Method Injection: Method injection involves passing dependencies to a class through methods other than the constructor or setter methods. In this model, the class declares a method that accepts the necessary dependencies as parameters, and the caller invokes that method to provide the dependencies. Here's an example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private Dependency dependency;

    public void injectDependency(Dependency dependency) {
        this.dependency = dependency;
    }

    // ...
}

```

The caller would create an instance of `MyClass` and call the `injectDependency` method to provide the required `Dependency` object. Method injection is useful when you want to provide dependencies at specific points during the lifecycle of an object.


5. Ambient Context: The Ambient Context model involves using a global or ambient context to access dependencies throughout the system. The dependencies are typically stored in a static or shared context that can be accessed from any part of the codebase. This model allows components to access dependencies without explicitly passing them as parameters. Here's an example:


```java
public class DependencyContext {
    private static Dependency dependency;

    public static Dependency getDependency() {
        return dependency;
    }

    public static void setDependency(Dependency dependency) {
        DependencyContext.dependency = dependency;
    }
}

public class MyClass {
    public void someMethod() {
        Dependency dependency = DependencyContext.getDependency();
        // Use the dependency...
    }

    // ...
}

```


The caller would set the required `Dependency` object in the `DependencyContext` before calling methods that rely on it. The class `MyClass` can then access the dependency through the static `getDependency` method. Ambient Context can be convenient but may introduce tighter coupling between components.


These models illustrate different ways to implement dependency injection in software systems. The choice of model depends on the specific requirements of the project, programming language, and the framework or libraries being used.
