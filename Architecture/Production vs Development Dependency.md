Deciding what should go into production versus being a development dependency in your project involves considerations related to efficiency, security, and best practices. Here's how you should think about what to put where:  
  
**Production Dependencies**:  
  
1. **Runtime Necessities**: Production dependencies are components, libraries, or packages that your application or system relies on to function correctly during runtime. These are essential for the core functionality of your application.  
  
2. **Optimization**: Production dependencies should be optimized for performance, size, and security. You want to ensure that they have a minimal impact on the end-user experience.  
  
3. **Security**: Consider the security of production dependencies. Make sure they are well-maintained, regularly updated, and have a good track record for security.  
  
4. **Third-Party Services**: If your project relies on third-party services or APIs, these are often production dependencies. Ensure they are reliable, well-documented, and have appropriate security measures in place.  
  
**Development Dependencies (DevDependencies)**:  
  
1. **Development and Testing Tools**: DevDependencies are tools, libraries, or packages that are only needed during the development and testing phases. They are not required in the production environment.  
  
2. **Build Tools**: Tools like transpilers (e.g., Babel, TypeScript), linters, test runners, and bundlers are examples of devDependencies. They help with code quality, testing, and bundling but are not part of the production application.  
  
3. **Development Servers**: Development servers and hot-reloading tools are typically used during development to improve the developer experience but are not used in production.  
  
4. **Testing Frameworks**: Testing frameworks, libraries, and utilities are used for writing and running tests during development but are not included in the production bundle.  
  
5. **Documentation and Code Quality Tools**: Tools for generating documentation, enforcing code style, or analyzing code quality are examples of devDependencies.  
  
**Considerations**:  
  
1. **Minimize Production Dependencies**: Keep production dependencies to a minimum to reduce the size and complexity of your production environment. Each added dependency introduces potential points of failure and security risks.  
  
2. **Efficiency**: Optimize your production environment for efficiency. Minimize network requests and ensure that production dependencies are well-maintained and efficient.  
  
3. **Security**: Carefully evaluate the security of production dependencies. Regularly update them to patch known vulnerabilities and follow best practices for security.  
  
4. **Performance**: Evaluate the performance impact of production dependencies, especially if they have a significant effect on loading times or runtime performance.  
  
5. **Developer Experience**: Prioritize a good developer experience by using devDependencies that make development and testing more efficient and enjoyable.  
  
6. **Documentation**: Clearly document the purpose of each dependency in your project to help maintainers and other developers understand why it's included.  
  
In summary, the decision of what should be a production dependency and what should be a devDependency should be based on the specific needs of your project, emphasizing efficiency, security, and a good developer experience. Keep the production environment lean and optimized while using development dependencies to enhance the development and testing process.
