Purpose: This documentation discusses file system storage which is a service not a database per say from what I gather. It also talks about when to consider using one in your system architecture.

A file is an unstructured collection of records, and file systems typically support two basic formats: Block Storage, organizing data in blocks on disk, commonly used in personal computers; and Object Storage, organizing data into containers of flexible sizes, prevalent in modern cloud systems like Amazon S3, designed for scalability, performance, and cost-effectiveness.

The characteristics of a Distributed File System (DFS) include:

- **Performance:** Ensuring high throughput and low access latency, comparable to local file systems.
  
- **Availability:** With distributed file systems spanning networks, it should maintain data accessibility in the face of partial node failures.
  
- **Scalability:** The ability to scale horizontally, supporting petabytes of data storage without disrupting client experiences as more nodes are added.
  
- **Reliability:** Highly reliable, minimizing the probability of data loss through mechanisms like backup copies.
  
- **Ease Of Use:** Providing a simple interface for common client operations such as reading, writing, and copying.
  
- **Data Integrity:** Ensuring consistency and preventing data loss when accessed by multiple users, often incorporating atomicity and consistency in operations.
  
- **Heterogeneity:** Supporting storage of diverse data types and allowing different clients to access and store data.

## When to consider 
In a system design interview, considering File System Storage as an option is crucial when:

1. **Data Sharing and Collaboration:**
   - *Scenario:* If the system requires multiple users or components to share and collaborate on files.
   - *Reasoning:* A file system provides a structured way to organize and share data, facilitating collaboration among different parts of the system.

2. **Scalability and Performance:**
   - *Scenario:* When the system is expected to handle a large volume of data that needs to scale horizontally.
   - *Reasoning:* File systems can be designed to scale horizontally, allowing the storage capacity to grow as more nodes are added to the system.

3. **Data Integrity and Consistency:**
   - *Scenario:* If maintaining data consistency and integrity is critical, especially in scenarios with concurrent access to data.
   - *Reasoning:* File systems often provide mechanisms such as atomic operations and consistency checks to ensure the integrity of data.

4. **Centralized Storage for Applications:**
   - *Scenario:* When applications within the system need a centralized location to store and retrieve data.
   - *Reasoning:* A file system provides a unified interface for applications to interact with stored data, simplifying data management and retrieval.

5. **Ease of Use and Accessibility:**
   - *Scenario:* If the system requires a user-friendly interface for common file operations like reading, writing, and copying.
   - *Reasoning:* File systems can offer straightforward operations, making it easier for clients or users to interact with and manage data.

6. **Backup and Recovery Requirements:**
   - *Scenario:* When the system needs a reliable backup solution for data recovery in case of failures or disasters.
   - *Reasoning:* File systems often incorporate features like backup copies, providing a safeguard against data loss.

7. **Support for Heterogeneous Data:**
   - *Scenario:* If the system deals with diverse types of data (structured, unstructured, files, records).
   - *Reasoning:* File systems can be designed to accommodate various data formats and support different types of clients accessing the storage.

When discussing File System Storage in a system design interview, it's essential to consider the specific requirements of the system, scalability needs, data access patterns, and the overall architecture to make an informed choice.

## Example of Data you May Store

Lets say your working on a healthcare system when using something like Amazon S3 various types of files can be stored to support different aspects of healthcare data management, compliance, and patient care. Here are some examples of files that could be saved in Amazon S3 within the context of a healthcare system:  
  
1. **Electronic Health Records (EHRs):**  
- **File Type:** Structured data files containing patient health records.  
- **Purpose:** Centralized storage of patient information, including medical history, diagnoses, medications, and treatment plans.  
  
2. **Medical Images:**  
- **File Type:** DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files for images like X-rays, MRIs, CT scans.  
- **Purpose:** Archiving and sharing medical images securely, allowing for easy access by healthcare professionals.  
  
3. **Lab Reports:**  
- **File Type:** PDFs, CSVs, or structured data files containing laboratory test results.  
- **Purpose:** Centralized storage of diagnostic test results, enabling efficient retrieval and analysis.  
  
4. **Patient Consent Forms:**  
- **File Type:** Scanned or digital copies of signed consent forms.  
- **Purpose:** Storing patient consent documents for legal and compliance purposes.  
  
5. **Prescription Documents:**  
- **File Type:** PDFs or structured data files containing prescription details.  
- **Purpose:** Centralized storage of medication prescriptions for patient history and compliance tracking.  
  
6. **Billing and Invoicing Documents:**  
- **File Type:** PDFs or structured data files related to billing and invoices.  
- **Purpose:** Archiving financial documents related to patient billing and insurance claims.  
  
7. **Healthcare Policies and Compliance Documents:**  
- **File Type:** PDFs or other document formats containing healthcare policies, compliance guidelines, and regulations.  
- **Purpose:** Storing and ensuring access to important regulatory documents for compliance purposes.  
  
8. **Research Data and Publications:**  
- **File Type:** PDFs, datasets, or research publications.  
- **Purpose:** Centralized storage of healthcare-related research data, facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing.  
  
9. **Training Materials:**  
- **File Type:** Multimedia files, presentations, or documents for healthcare staff training.  
- **Purpose:** Storing educational materials to support ongoing training and professional development.  
  
10. **Audit Trails and Logs:**  
- **File Type:** Log files containing system and user activity information.  
- **Purpose:** Tracking and auditing changes to healthcare data for security and compliance purposes.  
  
11. **Backup and Disaster Recovery Files:**  
- **File Type:** Regularly updated backups of critical healthcare data.  
- **Purpose:** Ensuring data resilience and enabling recovery in case of data loss or system failures.  
  
It's important to note that any healthcare data stored in Amazon S3 should comply with relevant healthcare data protection regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States or other applicable standards in different regions. Implementing appropriate security measures, access controls, and encryption is essential to safeguard patient privacy and ensure compliance.
