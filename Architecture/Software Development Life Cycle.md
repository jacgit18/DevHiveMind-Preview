-   Are there situations where one SDLC should be used over another? 
    
-   What steps are taken between Development and Testing in the Waterfall model? 
    
-   What are the phases of SDLC? What is included in the planning phase?  
    
    -   Planning  
        
        -   collects requirements, identifies, prioritizes, and assigns the tasks and resources necessary to build the project 
            
    -   Requirement analysis - an analysis of the requirements for the project, often through user stories 
        
    -   Design - configuration and research on the tools that will be utilized during development 
        
    -   Implementation - the implementation of code for the project 
        
    -   Testing - thorough testing of implemented code based on the requirements 
        
    -   Deployment - deployment of the project for users 
        
    -   Maintenance - continual maintenance of the deployed application, including bug fixes and optimization 
        
-   What kind of DLC have you used? Which is acceptable in certain situations? What is Agile Methodology? How does it differ from the Waterfall Model?  
    
    -   Agile  
        
        -   An iterative approach that is meant to deliver value to customers quicker 
            
        -   Good if there are few initial requirements with a flexible budget and if the project has high Product Owner involvement 
            
        -   Best if the product team requires flexibility and requirements are added during development. 
            
    -   Waterfall  
        
        -   More difficult to go back to if changes are necessary 
            
        -   A sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next can be started. Bottlenecks the process and can be costly. 
            
        -   More suitable for safety-critical projects where requirements are strict 
            
    -   DevOps  
        
        -   Developers and Operations teams work together closely — and sometimes as one team — to accelerate innovation and the deployment of higher-quality and more reliable software products and functionalities
