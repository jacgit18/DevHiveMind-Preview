Event Storming is a collaborative modeling technique designed to unite cross-functional teams in the exploration and comprehension of intricate business domains. This method proves particularly valuable for capturing the dynamic flow of events and interactions within a system. Typically conducted with sticky notes on a wall, Event Storming visually represents various facets of the domain, fostering a shared understanding among team members.

This collaborative approach to modeling serves as a catalyst for discussions and knowledge sharing, enabling the identification of crucial domain events, commands, and aggregates. By bringing together diverse perspectives, Event Storming helps uncover insights and align the team's understanding of the complex business domain.

## **Event Modeling**

Event Modeling takes the insights gained from Event Storming further by creating a structured model based on the identified events. This modeling process often emphasizes specific subdomains to delve deeper into the intricacies of the system.

The focus of Event Modeling is to refine and elaborate on the events identified during Event Storming. By creating a more formalized model, teams can better flesh out the relationships between events, commands, and aggregates. This process enhances clarity and provides a more detailed understanding of the subdomain under examination.

In essence, Event Modeling is an extension of the brainstorming session initiated by Event Storming. It transforms the insights generated during the collaborative exploration into a structured and visual representation, offering a comprehensive model that aids in the further development and understanding of the complex business domain.
