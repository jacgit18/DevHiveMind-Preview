In serverless architecture, you typically use functions as a service ([[Benefits of cloud#FAAS |FAAS]]). Here's a simple example using AWS Lambda and JavaScript:  
  
```javascript  
// index.js  
  
exports.handler = async (event) => {  
// Your serverless function logic here  
const response = {  
statusCode: 200,  
body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!'),  
};  
  
return response;  
};  
```  
  
In this example, the `handler` function is the entry point for your serverless function. It receives an event, processes it, and returns a response. This code can be deployed to AWS Lambda, and the function will be executed in response to events, such as HTTP requests, file uploads, etc.  
  
Note: This is a basic example, and real-world serverless applications might involve more complex setups, multiple functions, and interaction with other AWS services or external APIs.
