When designing microservices, it's generally considered a best practice to minimize dependencies between services, promoting independence and autonomy. However, the level of inter-service communication is a nuanced decision based on your specific use case and requirements. Here are some considerations:

### Minimizing Dependencies:  
  
1. **Autonomy:** Microservices are meant to be autonomous, independently deployable units. Minimizing dependencies allows each service to evolve independently without impacting others.  
  
2. **Resilience:** Reducing dependencies can enhance system resilience. If one service fails or undergoes changes, it's less likely to cause a cascading failure across other services.  
  
3. **Scale:** Independent services can be scaled individually, optimizing resources based on the specific needs of each service.  
  
### Inter-Service Communication:  
  
1. **Avoid Synchronous Communication:** Minimize synchronous communication between services, as it can introduce tight coupling and impact overall system performance and responsiveness.  
  
2. **Use Asynchronous Communication:** Prefer asynchronous communication patterns like message queues or event-driven architectures. This allows services to communicate without being directly dependent on each other's availability.  
  
3. **APIs for Loose Coupling:** If direct communication is necessary, expose well-defined APIs. This helps in maintaining loose coupling between services.  
  
4. **Service Mesh:** Consider using a service mesh for managing communication between microservices. Service meshes provide features like load balancing, fault tolerance, and observability.  
  
### Common Practices:  
  
1. **Event-Driven Architectures:** Many microservices architectures leverage events and message queues for communication. This allows services to react to events without direct coupling.  
  
2. **RESTful APIs:** When direct communication is necessary, RESTful APIs are commonly used. However, be cautious about overusing synchronous HTTP calls.  
  
3. **Service Discovery:** Implement service discovery mechanisms so that services can dynamically locate and communicate with each other.  
  
4. **API Gateways:** Use API gateways for managing external access to microservices. This can help in handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, and routing.  
  
### When Direct Communication is Acceptable:  
  
1. **Bounded Context:** If two microservices are part of the same bounded context, direct communication might be acceptable. However, strive to keep dependencies minimal even within a bounded context.  
  
2. **Small Teams:** In situations where small teams manage multiple microservices, they may have more control and understanding of the interdependencies.  
  
3. **Performance Considerations:** For certain performance-critical scenarios, synchronous communication may be necessary. However, these should be carefully evaluated and optimized.  
  
In summary, while minimizing dependencies is a general best practice in microservices architecture, the appropriate level of communication between services depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your system. Always consider factors like autonomy, resilience, and scalability in your design decisions.
