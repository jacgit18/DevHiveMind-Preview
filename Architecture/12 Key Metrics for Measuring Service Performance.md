## Time to First Byte (TTFB)

TTFB measures the time taken from the moment a client sends a request to a server until the client receives the first byte of data from the server. It is an indicator of server responsiveness and network latency. Example: A website’s TTFB is 200 milliseconds, indicating a fast initial response from the server.


## Latency

Latency is the time taken for a request to travel from the sender to the receiver and for the response to travel back. It is a measure of the delay experienced in a system. Example: The time taken for a user’s request to reach a server and receive a response is 100 milliseconds.

## Throughput

Throughput measures the number of operations or requests processed by a system per unit of time. It is an indicator of the system’s capacity to handle workloads. Example: An API handling 500 requests per second.

## Response Time

Response time is the total time taken for a system to process a request, including the time spent waiting in queues and the actual processing time. It helps in assessing the system’s efficiency in handling user requests. Example: A database query takes 250 milliseconds to complete, including 50 milliseconds spent in the queue.

## Error Rate

Error rate is the percentage of requests that result in errors, such as timeouts or failures, compared to the total number of requests. A lower error rate indicates higher system reliability. Example: Out of 10,000 requests, 100 fail, resulting in an error rate of 1%.

## Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

MTBF is the average time between system failures or disruptions. It is an indicator of system reliability and the effectiveness of maintenance procedures. Example: A server has an MTBF of 30,000 hours, which means it is expected to operate without failure for an average of 30,000 hours.

## Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)

MTTR measures the average time taken to repair or recover from a system failure. A lower MTTR indicates a more efficient recovery process and reduced downtime. Example: A system has an MTTR of 2 hours, indicating that it takes an average of 2 hours to restore operations after a failure.

## Network Bandwidth

Network bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a network connection. It is an essential metric for evaluating network performance and determining potential bottlenecks. Example: A network connection with a bandwidth of 100 Mbps can transfer 100 megabits of data per second.

## Request Rate

Request rate is the number of requests received by a system per unit of time. Monitoring request rate helps identify trends, potential bottlenecks, and areas for optimization. Example: A web server receives 300 requests per minute during peak hours.

## Concurrent Connections

Concurrent connections represent the number of active connections to a system at a given moment. This metric helps assess the system’s capacity to handle multiple simultaneous requests. Example: A database server can handle 5,000 concurrent connections without performance degradation.

## Cache Hit Ratio

Cache hit ratio is the percentage of cache accesses that result in a cache hit, indicating that the requested data is found in the cache. A higher cache hit ratio suggests better cache efficiency and faster response times. Example: A cache with a 90% hit ratio successfully serves 9 out of 10 requests from the cache.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA) Compliance

SLA compliance is the percentage of time that a system meets its predefined performance and availability objectives. A higher SLA compliance rate indicates better system performance and customer satisfaction. Example: A cloud service provider maintains 99.95% SLA compliance, meaning it meets its performance targets 99.95% of the time.















Velocity: This is a popular metric used to measure a team's ability to complete work in a given time period. TechBeacon defines it as how many units of software the team typically completes in an iteration. This metric can be used to assess an individual's productivity and how much they are contributing to the team's velocity.  
  
Cycle time: This metric measures the time it takes to complete a single work item, from the start of development to the deployment of the finished product. This metric can be used to assess an individual's ability to deliver quality work in a timely manner.  
  
Lead time: This metric measures the time it takes from when a work item is requested to when it is completed and deployed. It can be used to measure an individual's ability to prioritize tasks and work efficiently.  
  
Quality and comprehensiveness of testing: The quality and comprehensiveness of testing can greatly affect the quality of the final product. Metrics such as the number of bugs found and fixed, the code coverage of unit tests, and the frequency of test failures can be used to assess an individual's ability to write and execute effective tests.  
  
Learning progress: It is important for software engineers to continually learn and improve their skills. Metrics such as the number of training courses completed, the number of new programming languages or technologies learned, and the number of contributions to open source projects can be used to assess an individual's learning progress and dedication to self-improvement.  
  
It is important to note that while these metrics can provide valuable insights, they should not be used as the sole means of evaluating an individual's skills and learning. Other factors such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving abilities should also be considered.
