Reactive Programming is a programming paradigm that deals with asynchronous data streams and the [[Tech Glossary#^5487d3|propagation]] of changes. Unlike being tied to a specific architectural style, it primarily focuses on how code handles events and asynchronous data. 

In essence, reactive programming concentrates on how individual components or parts of a system manage and respond to data streams. 

## Data Streams:

In the realm of reactive programming, the emphasis lies in utilizing reactive extensions (such as RxJava and RxJS) for working with data streams and sequences. This involves introducing concepts like Observables, Observers, and transformations to adeptly manage asynchronous and event-driven scenarios.

## Focus on Data Flow:

Reactive programming is primarily centered around the efficient flow of data and how alterations in one part of the system can be effectively propagated and responded to in other parts of the system.

### Use Case:

In practice, reactive programming finds utility in scenarios where you need to handle user interface events, data streaming, or any situation that demands efficient propagation of changes throughout the system.

Notably, reactive programming is known for its heavy reliance on declarative coding, which is becoming a standard approach, as it promotes standardization and prevents individuals from resorting to idiosyncratic practices.
