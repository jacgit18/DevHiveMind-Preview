Developers frequently use "library" and "framework" interchangeably, but there's a crucial difference between them.

**Library Analogy - Ikea Furniture:**
- A library is comparable to Ikea; you have an existing home but need assistance with furniture.
- Libraries allow you to pick and choose components, maintaining control over your application.

**Framework Analogy - Model Home Construction:**
- A framework is like building a model home with blueprints and limited design choices.
- The framework and its blueprint are in control, guiding your input at specific points.

**Inversion of Control (IoC):**
- The technical distinction lies in IoC, where a library lets you control the application flow, while a framework takes charge of it.

**Framework Benefits - SSR and SEO:**
- Frameworks often incorporate Server-Side Rendering (SSR), supporting Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

**Example: jQuery (Library) vs. Vue.js (Framework):**
- Using jQuery (library), you control the flow and call the library as needed.
- With Vue.js (framework), the framework manages the flow, calling your code at specified points.

**Lightweight Library vs. Heavy Framework:**
- A library, like jQuery, is lightweight and adaptable, applicable throughout the code base.
- A framework, such as React, is more substantial, addressing both frontend and backend workflows. React is specifically tailored to frontend development.
