Software is intentionally crafted for regular updates, allowing for seamless modifications or removal within a system, albeit with potential risks such as data loss. In contrast, firmware refers to specialized software embedded in hardware devices, crucial for their optimal functioning. This distinction emphasizes the significance of firmware as an integral component tightly integrated with hardware for overall system stability.
