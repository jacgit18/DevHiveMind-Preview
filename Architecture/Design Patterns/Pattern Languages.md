Pattern languages are broader and more comprehensive collections of related patterns that provide guidance for solving complex problems in a particular domain. They collectively address design problems in a particular domain. They are often used in software design but have broader applications. 

Pattern Languages are not limited to software code and can encompass various aspects of software development, such as architecture, user experience, process, and organization. They help create a shared understanding and a common language for solving complex problems within a specific domain.

Here are a few examples:

1. **Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns:**
   - This is one of the most well-known pattern languages in software design. It includes patterns like Singleton, Observer, Factory Method, etc., each addressing common design problems.

2. **Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP):**
   - EIP provides a collection of patterns to address the challenges of integrating different systems. Examples include Message Channel, Message Router, and Publish-Subscribe Channel.

3. **Security Patterns:**
   - Patterns in this language address various security concerns. For instance, "Role-Based Access Control" and "Secure Proxy" are patterns used to secure applications.

4. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Patterns:**
   - DDD introduces patterns such as "Entity," "Value Object," and "Repository" to help design and implement complex business domains effectively.

5. **Microservices Patterns:**
   - Patterns in the microservices architecture context include "Service Registry," "API Gateway," and "Circuit Breaker," which help in designing and managing microservices-based systems.

6. **User Interface (UI) Design Patterns:**
   - Examples include "Model-View-Controller (MVC)," "Observer Pattern" for UI events, and "Master-Detail" for organizing information hierarchically.

7. **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Patterns:**
   - Patterns such as "Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)" and "Mock Object" provide guidance on structuring tests and handling dependencies for effective test-driven development.

8. **Concurrency Patterns:**
   - Patterns like "Producer-Consumer" and "Readers-Writers" address challenges in concurrent programming, providing solutions for managing shared resources.

9. **Analysis Patterns:**
   - These patterns focus on capturing and modeling business domain concepts. Examples include "Party," "Role," and "Money" patterns.

10. **Pedestrian Infrastructure Design Patterns:**
    - In urban planning, there are patterns for designing pedestrian-friendly spaces, like "Curb Extensions" and "Plaza," contributing to safer and more accessible environments.

These examples showcase the versatility of pattern languages, demonstrating their application in various domains beyond just software design. Each pattern language provides a set of solutions to recurring problems, fostering best practices and shared knowledge within a specific context.
