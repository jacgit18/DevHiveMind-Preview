In a system design interview, the balance between breadth and depth is crucial. The scope of your discussion should be broad enough to demonstrate your understanding of the system as a whole, yet focused enough to dive deep into the critical components that highlight your technical strengths and the specifics of the problem at hand. Here’s how to approach scoping and what to mention versus what to avoid:  
  
### Things to Mention  
  
1. **High-Level Architecture:**  
- Start with an overview of the system architecture. This shows you understand how different components fit together.  
  
2. **Key Components:**  
- Focus on the main components necessary for the system to function. This could include databases, APIs, caching strategies, load balancers, etc.  
  
3. **Data Flow:**  
- Describe how data moves through your system. This demonstrates your understanding of interactions between components.  
  
4. **Scalability:**  
- Discuss how your system can scale to handle growth, whether it's through horizontal scaling, sharding, or other strategies.  
  
5. **Availability and Reliability:**  
- Mention strategies for ensuring high availability and reliability, such as replication, failover mechanisms, and consistent hashing.  
  
6. **Security:**  
- Cover basic security considerations, like authentication, authorization, encryption, and data protection.  
  
7. **Performance Optimization:**  
- Highlight any specific performance optimizations, such as caching, database indexing, or query optimization.  
  
8. **Cost-Effective Solutions:**  
- If applicable, mention how you would optimize for cost without significantly compromising on performance or reliability.  
  
### Things to Avoid  
  
1. **Overly Granular Details:**  
- Avoid going into excessive detail about well-understood or minor components that don't significantly impact your overall design.  
  
2. **Irrelevant Technologies:**  
- Don't focus on specific technologies unless they are directly relevant to your design or explicitly requested by the interviewer. Keep your solutions generalized enough to demonstrate your architectural understanding.  
  
3. **Ignoring Trade-offs:**  
- Avoid presenting your design as flawless. Every design has trade-offs. Be prepared to discuss these and why you made certain choices.  
  
4. **Rigid Solutions:**  
- Don’t stick too rigidly to your first proposal. Be open to feedback and willing to iterate on your design based on the interviewer’s questions.  
  
5. **Neglecting Data Consistency and Integrity:**  
- Omitting how your system ensures data consistency and integrity can be a red flag. Even if not in your initial design, be prepared to discuss this if asked.  
  
6. **Failing to Ask Questions:**  
- Avoid making assumptions without clarification. It’s a missed opportunity to demonstrate your thought process and understanding of requirements.  
  
### Tips for a Balanced Scope  
  
- **Clarify Requirements Upfront:** Ask questions to understand the scale of the system, the expected load, and any specific requirements or constraints.  
- **Iterative Approach:** Start with a high-level design and then iteratively dive deeper into each component, focusing on areas where you have strengths or where the interviewer seems more interested.  
- **Address Feedback:** Be attentive to the interviewer's feedback or questions as cues to adjust the depth or direction of your discussion.  
  
By managing your scope effectively, you demonstrate not just technical expertise but also critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and the ability to communicate complex systems clearly.
