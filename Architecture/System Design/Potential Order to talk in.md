1. **Requirements Clarification:**
   - Understand the goals and constraints of the system.
   - Ask relevant questions to gather more information.

2. **High-Level Design:**
   - Identify major components/modules that make up the system.
   - Discuss how these components interact with each other.

3. **Data Storage:**
   - Choose appropriate databases based on requirements (e.g., relational, NoSQL).
   - Discuss data schema, indexing, and data retrieval strategies.

4. **System Communication:**
   - Define communication protocols between system components.

5. **Scalability:**
   - Address how the system can handle increased load.
   - Discuss horizontal and vertical scaling strategies.

6. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Identify potential bottlenecks and propose optimizations.
   - Discuss caching, load balancing, and other performance-enhancing techniques.

7. **Fault Tolerance:**
   - Discuss strategies for handling failures and ensuring system reliability.
   - Cover topics like redundancy, graceful degradation, and error handling.

8. **Security:**
   - Address security concerns such as data encryption, authentication, and authorization.
   - Discuss measures to protect against common vulnerabilities.

9. **Trade-offs:**
   - Acknowledge any trade-offs made during the design process.
   - Discuss the reasoning behind your design choices.

10. **Conclusion:**
    - Summarize the key aspects of your design.
