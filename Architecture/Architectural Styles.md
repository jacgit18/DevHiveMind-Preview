Some common architectural styles in system design include:

1. **Monolithic Architecture:** A single, unified codebase for the entire application.

2. **Microservices Architecture:** Breaking down the application into small, independent services that communicate with each other.

3. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):** Designing the system as a collection of services that interact with each other.

4. **Client-Server Architecture:** Separating the user interface (client) from the backend (server) to enable communication between them.

5. **RESTful Architecture:** Using Representational State Transfer principles for designing networked applications.

6. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Components communicate through events, allowing for asynchronous processing.

7. **Layered Architecture:** Structuring the system into layers (e.g., presentation, business logic, data) to improve maintainability.

8. **Component-Based Architecture:** Building the system using reusable and replaceable software components.

9. **Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) Architecture:** Focusing on the separation of concerns by defining clear boundaries between components.

10. **Blockchain Architecture:** Implementing a decentralized and distributed ledger system.

These architectural styles provide different approaches to organizing and structuring systems based on specific design principles and requirements.
