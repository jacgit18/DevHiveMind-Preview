Database data governance involves establishing and maintaining policies, procedures, and standards to ensure the quality, integrity, and security of data within a database. It encompasses activities such as data classification, access control, data auditing, and data lifecycle management.

The database records lifecycle refers to the stages a piece of data goes through from its creation or capture to its eventual archival or deletion. It typically involves stages like creation, storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion. Data governance plays a crucial role in this lifecycle by providing guidelines on how data should be handled at each stage.

For example, data governance policies may dictate who has access to certain types of data, how data should be classified based on sensitivity, and how long it should be retained. This aligns with the database records lifecycle, as it ensures that data is managed responsibly and in accordance with organizational policies throughout its entire existence in the database.
