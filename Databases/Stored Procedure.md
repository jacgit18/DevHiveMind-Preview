A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that are stored in a database and can be executed as a single unit. It is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that are stored together in the database management system (DBMS). Here are key points about stored procedures:

1. **Stored Logic:** Stored procedures can include SQL statements as well as procedural programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, and error handling. This allows for the creation of more complex and reusable logic within the database.

2. **Precompiled:** Stored procedures are precompiled and stored in a compiled form in the database. This can result in better performance compared to executing individual SQL statements separately because the database doesn't have to recompile the code each time it is executed.

3. **Encapsulation:** Stored procedures provide a way to encapsulate and centralize business logic within the database. This promotes code reuse, maintenance, and security by controlling access to the underlying data.

4. **Security:** Database administrators can grant specific permissions to execute stored procedures, allowing fine-grained control over who can access and modify data. This helps in implementing security measures at the database level.

5. **Reduced Network Traffic:** Since the logic is stored and executed on the database server, there is often reduced network traffic between the application and the database server, especially for complex operations that can be performed within the stored procedure.

6. **Transaction Control:** Stored procedures can be used to group multiple SQL statements into a single transaction, ensuring that either all the statements are executed successfully or none of them are.

To create a stored procedure, one typically uses a specific syntax supported by the database system (e.g., PL/SQL for Oracle, T-SQL for Microsoft SQL Server). Once created, a stored procedure can be called by applications or other parts of the database to execute the predefined logic.
