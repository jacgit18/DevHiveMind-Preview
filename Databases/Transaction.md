### Transactions
- A database transaction is  a sequence of operations that is performed on a database that can also be performed as a single unit of work typically through [[Stored Procedure]] or alternative methods.
- PostgreSQL ensures that all operations within a transaction either complete entirely or none of them do.
- This property prevents incomplete changes in case of a failure during a transaction.
- Transactions typically begin with a BEGIN command and end with a COMMIT or ROLLBACK.

#### Commit and Rollback
- **Commit:** Marks the successful end of a transaction, indicating that changes should become permanent.
- **Rollback:** Marks the unsuccessful end, discarding any changes made since the beginning of the transaction.

### Indexing
- An index is a data structure reducing the time for certain operations and ensuring no unwanted duplicate values.
- RDM supports hash and b-tree indexing types.
- Indexing allows fast access to a table's rows based on the data values of indexed columns.

### Key Concepts
- **Concurrency:** Two or more processes executing simultaneously.
- **Connection:** Communication means between a client and a server, with a process having multiple connections.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that the database state remains consistent before and after the execution of a transaction.

### Additional Database Concepts
- **Deadlock:** A situation where resources are held by two or more connections needed by each other, causing an infinite wait loop.
- **Distributed Database:** Data distributed among multiple computers or devices, facilitating simultaneous access.
- **DLL (Dynamic Link Library):** Contains related functions not loaded into memory until called, used in RDM APIs.
- **DML (Database Manipulation Language):** Includes SQL statements like UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE.
- **Durability:** Ensures committed transactions survive system failures.

### More Database Terminology
- **Edge Computing:** Computing infrastructure close to data sources, beneficial for IoT, IIoT, 5G, and AI applications.
- **Embedded Database:** Resides within an application, combining database and controlling software.
- **Encryption:** Encoding data to make it unreadable without the encryption key.
- **Fog Computing:** Distributes computing, storage, and networking closer to users in the Cloud-to-Thing continuum.
- **Geospatial Datatypes:** Optimized for storing geographic coordinate-based data.

### Continued Database Definitions
- **Hash:** Indexing method providing fast retrieval based on matching column values.
- **Hierarchical Model:** Special case of a network model database where each record type can participate in only one set.
- **Hot Spot:** A bottleneck created by a frequently used and updated single shared row in a database.
- **Implicit Locking:** SQL automatically applies locks needed for safe execution in a multiuser environment.
- **IMDB (In-Memory Database):** Keeps the entire database or table contents in computer memory.

### Further Database Concepts
- **Isolation:** Ensures changes made by a transaction are isolated from the rest of the system until after commitment.
- **Little-Endian:** Data storage convention where the least significant bit is stored first.
- **Local Procedure Call:** Software function call to a library function in the same process.
- **Locking:** Safely protects objects from being changed by multiple users simultaneously.
- **Memory Database:** Keeps the entire database or table in computer memory.
- **Mirroring:** Copies transaction changes from a master database to one or more slave databases.

### Additional Database Terminology
- **Multi-version Concurrency Control (MVCC):** Allows multiple types of database access simultaneously.
- **Optimizer:** Estimates the optimum method to access data in response to an SQL statement.
- **Page Size and Page:** Basic unit of database file input/output and associated data in the file.
- **Positioned Update/Delete:** SQL UPDATE or DELETE statement modifying the current row of a cursor.

### Conclusion
- The note covers essential concepts related to transactions, indexing, and various database terminologies.
- It provides a comprehensive overview of key database elements, ensuring a clear understanding of fundamental principles.
