Consider the dynamics of database table relationships when crafting business logic within a codebase. As data tables and their associations may evolve over time, it's essential to maintain flexibility in your code. Organize endpoints in alignment with the dependencies of database tables to ensure a structured and coherent approach. Additionally, when handling network request bodies, leverage interfaces to seamlessly append data to fields that might not currently exist in the tables.

Key considerations:

1. **Dynamic Table Relationships:**
   - Recognize that the relationships between database tables can change. Design your code to accommodate such changes without causing significant disruptions.

2. **Endpoint Organization:**
   - Structure endpoints in accordance with the dependencies of database tables. This helps maintain clarity and coherence in your codebase, making it easier to follow and extend.

3. **Flexibility in Business Logic:**
   - Build business logic with adaptability in mind. Avoid hard-coding assumptions about table relationships to enable smoother adjustments as the database schema evolves.

4. **Modular Code Design:**
   - Encapsulate business logic into modular components. This not only enhances maintainability but also allows for easier updates when database changes occur.

5. **Interfaces for Data Appending:**
   - Use interfaces to seamlessly append data to fields that may not currently exist in database tables. This enables your code to gracefully handle additional information without disrupting existing structures.

6. **Versioning and Documentation:**
   - Implement versioning for your APIs to manage changes systematically. Document these changes comprehensively to ensure that developers are informed about modifications to table relationships and endpoints.

7. **Validation and Error Handling:**
   - Include robust validation mechanisms in your code to handle unexpected changes in data structures. Implement thorough error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where data appending or modification encounters issues.

8. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Rigorously test your codebase, especially when database changes are implemented. Comprehensive testing helps identify and address potential issues early in the development process.

9. **Collaboration with Database Designers:**
   - Maintain open communication with database designers. Collaborate to understand upcoming changes in table relationships and plan accordingly.

10. **Scalability Considerations:**
   - Design your codebase to scale efficiently. Consider potential increases in data volume and complexity resulting from changes in table relationships.

By embracing a flexible and well-organized approach, your codebase can gracefully adapt to evolving database structures, providing a foundation for scalable and maintainable systems.

## Example
Here is_admin is not apart of the actual database table schema it is being appended to be leverage in business logic

```typescript
export interface JwtUserInfo {
  email: string,
  id: string,
  first_name: string,
  last_name: string,
  is_admin: boolean,
}

export interface JwtData {
  email: string,
  id: string,
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
  name: string,
  is_admin: boolean,
}

function convertUserInfoToJwtData(userInfo: JwtUserInfo): JwtData {
  return {
    email: userInfo.email,
    id: userInfo.id,
    firstName: userInfo.first_name,
    lastName: userInfo.last_name,
    name: `${userInfo.first_name} ${userInfo.last_name}`,
    is_admin: userInfo.is_admin,
  }
}
```
