Cloud databases fall into different service models within cloud computing:

1. **[[Benefits of cloud#SAAS |SAAS]] (Software as a Service):** Cloud databases under SaaS typically provide storage and data analytical tools. Users access these services through a web interface, and the provider manages infrastructure, maintenance, and updates.

2. **[[Benefits of cloud#IAAS |IAAS]] (Infrastructure as a Service):** In the IaaS model, cloud databases offer storage without integrated data analytical tools. Users have more control over the infrastructure but are responsible for managing aspects like security and updates.

3. **[[Benefits of cloud#PAAS |PAAS]] (Platform as a Service):** Cloud databases under PaaS fall in between, providing storage along with additional functionality. The platform takes care of infrastructure management, and users focus more on application development.

The benefits of cloud databases include performance at scale, security, high availability, and full management by the cloud provider. Additionally, they grant access to other cloud services, such as AWS CloudTrail, which aids in governance, compliance, and auditing of AWS account activities, ensuring operational transparency and risk management.
