A dump file in PostgreSQL is a textual or binary representation of a database's schema and/or data. It serves various purposes, including backup, migration, and replication. Dump files allow you to recreate a database or transfer it to another server.  
  
To generate a dump file in PostgreSQL, you can use the `pg_dump` utility. For example:  
  
```bash  
pg_dump -U username -h localhost -d dbname > dumpfile.sql  
```  
  
This command exports the database named "dbname" to a SQL file named "dumpfile.sql." Adjust the parameters like username, host, and format based on your specific setup and requirements.
