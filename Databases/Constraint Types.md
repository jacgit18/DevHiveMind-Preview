In databases, there are various types of constraints:

1. **Primary Key Constraint:** Ensures each record in a table is uniquely identified.

2. **Unique Constraint:** Ensures that values in a column or a group of columns are unique.

3. **Foreign Key Constraint:** Maintains referential integrity between two tables by linking a column in one table to a column in another.

4. **Check Constraint:** Verifies that values in a column meet a specific condition.

5. **Default Constraint:** Specifies a default value for a column when no other value is specified.

6. **Not Null Constraint:** Ensures that a column cannot have a null value.

These constraints help maintain data accuracy, consistency, and integrity within a database.
