UI testing, or User Interface testing, is the process of evaluating the functionality of a software application's user interface. It involves checking whether the user interface behaves as intended, ensuring that users can interact with the software seamlessly. This type of testing typically focuses on aspects like navigation, usability, responsiveness, and overall user experience. Testers simulate user interactions with the graphical elements of the application, such as buttons, menus, and forms, to identify and address potential issues before the software is released. The goal is to guarantee a smooth and error-free user interface for end-users.
