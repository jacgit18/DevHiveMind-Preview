## Ranorex: Black Box Security Testing Tools

Ranorex Studio is a GUI test automation framework provided by Ranorex GmbH, a software development company. The framework is used for the testing of desktop, web-based and mobile applications.

It provides an array of tools for different types of black box testing as a comprehensive solution, so regardless of what type of testing you need to employ, we can help you implement it.


### Black Box Test Automation

With Ranorex Studio, you can automate your black box testing by selecting from a range of various test types. These will help you address a range of issues that may arise..

### UI Object Recognition

Ranorex Studio also tracks and analyzes all elements of your user interface and inputs them into a repository for your convenience. This allows you to maintain and manage all identified objects with ease even when your UI changes.


### Data-Driven Testing

You can additionally automate data-driven testing by using corner, edge, or boundary cases by setting up variables, linking them to external data sets, and looping through the data. Ranorex Studio even allows you to determine whether to stop a test as a result of a failure or to continue with the next test.


### Keyword-Driven Testing

Keyword-driven testing relies on action words that represent the user’s behavior. These include words like “Log On” or “Close Window.” It separately documents the steps that the user actually takes to perform the action. Ranorex Studio provides tools to make automated keyword-driven testing accessible and repeatable.


### Cross-Device and Cross-Browser Testing

Ranorex Studio allows you to automate tests on one operating system and then execute them locally or remotely on another. This type of testing ensures that all users, regardless of their system, have a consistent experience.


### Customizable Reporting

You can monitor the results of your testing with Ranorex Studio’s customizable reports. These reports can include pie charts, screenshots, and detailed error logs. Additionally, you can jump directly into testing from the report.


### Black Box Penetration Testing

Black box penetration testing demonstrates how an attacker would try to perform an attack on a software without any knowledge about the internal code. This test can also be automated to ensure potential weaknesses are addressed before a breach occurs.


## Benefits of Automated Black Box Testing

#### Simple implementation

To perform the tests, users don’t need to have technical knowledge/skills because the tests do not look at the code of a particular software.

#### Convenient execution

Execution can be outsourced to external testers or automated because you are solely looking at the functionality of the software.

#### Accuracy

The risk of false positives is extremely low, and you can be certain that your testing will address all possible issues.

#### Reduced complexity

Tests can be quite simple since they seek to model common user behavior. As such, they don’t require learning the system details.
