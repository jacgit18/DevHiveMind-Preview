Data-Driven Testing is not necessarily about mock data, although mock data can be used as part of a data-driven testing strategy. Data-Driven Testing is a testing approach that focuses on running the same test script or test case with multiple sets of data to validate how the system or application behaves under various input conditions. 

Here's how Data-Driven Testing works:

1. **Test Script**: You have a test script or test case that defines a series of steps or actions to be executed.

2. **Data Sets**: You create multiple sets of test data, often including both valid and invalid data, as well as boundary or edge cases.

3. **Iteration**: The same test script is executed iteratively for each data set.

4. **Verification**: The results of each iteration are verified against expected outcomes. 

Data-Driven Testing offers several benefits:

- **Reusability**: The same test script can be reused with different data sets, making it more efficient and reducing duplication.

- **Coverage**: It helps ensure that a wide range of test scenarios are covered, which can be especially useful in finding unexpected issues.

- **Scalability**: As new test data becomes available or the system evolves, you can easily expand your testing without changing the test script.

Mock data can be a component of data sets used in Data-Driven Testing. For example, you might use mock data to simulate various scenarios or conditions. However, data sets can also include real data, edge cases, and other types of inputs. The key is to systematically test the application with different data to ensure it behaves correctly in various situations.

In summary, Data-Driven Testing is a broader concept that involves testing with multiple sets of data, and while mock data can be part of this approach, it's not limited to just using mock data.
