Functional Acceptance Testing (FAT) is a testing phase that focuses on verifying that the software system meets the specified functional requirements as outlined in the project's requirements documentation. This type of testing is conducted to ensure that the entire application or system functions correctly as a whole, rather than just validating individual components or features.

**Key aspects of Functional Acceptance Testing:**

1. **Scope:** FAT evaluates the end-to-end functionality of the software, assessing how different components and features interact with each other in a real-world scenario.

2. **Participants:** Testing teams and business stakeholders are actively involved in Functional Acceptance Testing. It often requires collaboration between technical experts and end-users to ensure that the system aligns with the intended business objectives.

3. **Timing:** Functional Acceptance Testing typically occurs after functional testing and non-functional testing. It serves as an intermediate step before final acceptance testing.

4. **Test Cases:** Test scenarios for Functional Acceptance Testing are derived from the functional requirements specified during the project's planning and design phases. These test cases are designed to validate that the software functions in accordance with the established criteria.

5. **Validation Criteria:** The acceptance criteria for Functional Acceptance Testing are typically defined based on the client's or end-users' expectations. It ensures that the software meets the business goals and requirements set forth during the project.

6. **Defects and Issues:** Any defects or issues identified during Functional Acceptance Testing are reported and addressed before moving on to the final acceptance testing phase. This iterative process ensures that the system is thoroughly tested and refined.

In summary, Functional Acceptance Testing is a critical step in the testing process, providing assurance that the software, as a whole, meets the functional requirements set by the stakeholders. It helps bridge the gap between individual feature testing and overall system acceptance, contributing to the delivery of a reliable and well-functioning software product.
