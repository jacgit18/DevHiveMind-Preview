Non-functional testing is a type of software testing that evaluates attributes or characteristics of a system that are not related to specific behaviors or functions. Unlike functional testing, which verifies whether the software functions as expected, non-functional testing assesses qualities like performance, usability, reliability, and security. Here are some key aspects of non-functional testing:  
  
1. **Performance Testing:**  
- **Objective:** To evaluate how well the system performs under different conditions, including load, stress, and scalability testing.  
- **Examples:** Load testing checks system performance under expected load, stress testing assesses the system's behavior under extreme conditions, and scalability testing measures how well the system can handle growing demands.  
  
2. **Usability Testing:**  
- **Objective:** To assess the user interface and overall user experience of the software validating how well a customer can use a system or web application to complete a task. 
- **Examples:** Usability testing focuses on factors such as ease of use, navigation, and user satisfaction. It ensures that the application is user-friendly and meets the expectations of its intended users.  
  
3. **Reliability Testing:**  
- **Objective:** To evaluate the system's ability to consistently perform as expected over time.  
- **Examples:** Reliability testing assesses the system's stability, availability, and fault tolerance. It helps identify and address issues related to system reliability.  
  
4. **Security Testing:**  
- **Objective:** To identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system's security mechanisms.  
- **Examples:** Security testing involves activities such as penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and authentication testing to ensure that the system is resistant to unauthorized access and potential security threats.  
  
5. **Scalability Testing:**  
- **Objective:** To determine how well the system can scale to accommodate increased demands or user loads.  
- **Examples:** Scalability testing assesses the system's ability to handle growing amounts of data, increased user traffic, or additional functionalities without a significant drop in performance.  
  
6. **Compatibility Testing:**  
- **Objective:** To ensure that the software functions correctly across different environments, platforms, and configurations.  
- **Examples:** Compatibility testing checks the application's compatibility with various browsers, operating systems, devices, and network environments.  
  
7. **Maintainability Testing:**  
- **Objective:** To assess how easily the software can be maintained and updated.  
- **Examples:** Maintainability testing evaluates factors like code readability, documentation, and the ease with which changes can be implemented without causing unintended consequences.  
  
Non-functional testing is crucial for ensuring that a software system not only meets the functional requirements but also satisfies the broader criteria related to performance, usability, reliability, and security. These tests help validate that the software meets user expectations and performs well in diverse and challenging environments.
