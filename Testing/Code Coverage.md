A code coverage tool is a software development tool that measures the extent to which your source code is tested by your test suite. It helps you understand how thoroughly your tests exercise your codebase. Code coverage tools generate reports that show which parts of your code have been executed by your tests and which parts have not.  
  
There are several key metrics that code coverage tools typically measure:  
  
1. **Statement Coverage**: This metric tracks which lines of code (statements) have been executed at least once during testing. It indicates the percentage of statements covered by tests.  
  
2. **Branch Coverage**: Branch coverage measures the percentage of decision points (branches) in your code that have been tested. It ensures that both true and false branches of conditional statements are exercised.  
  
3. **Function Coverage**: Function coverage measures the percentage of functions or methods in your codebase that have been called during testing.  
  
4. **Line Coverage**: Similar to statement coverage, line coverage measures the percentage of lines that have been executed. However, it might not distinguish between different statements on the same line.  
  
Code coverage tools are valuable for several reasons:  
  
- They help you identify areas of your code that lack test coverage, enabling you to focus your testing efforts on these areas.  
- They provide quantitative data about your test suite's effectiveness and help you make informed decisions about whether additional tests are needed.  
- They promote code quality by encouraging thorough testing and reducing the likelihood of undiscovered bugs.  
  
Popular code coverage tools for different programming languages include Istanbul (nyc) for JavaScript, JaCoCo for Java, [Coverage.py](http://coverage.py/) for Python, and many more. These tools are often integrated with test frameworks and can be used in Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines to track and improve code coverage over time.
