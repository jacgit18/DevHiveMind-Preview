Functional testing ensures that a software application or system operates according to its specified requirements by emulating business scenarios. This verification is often performed through [[Type of Testing Techniques#BLACK BOX TESTING|black-box testing]], examining the software's functions without delving into its internal code.

The goal is to ensure that each individual function or feature of the software behaves correctly according to the functional specifications. Here are key aspects of functional testing:  
  
1. **Validation of Functions:**  
- Functional testing validates that each function of the software performs as expected and produces the correct outputs based on given inputs.  
  
2. **Testing Scenarios:**  
- Functional testing involves designing test scenarios based on the functional specifications, business requirements, and use cases. These scenarios represent real-world interactions with the software.  
  
3. **Types of Functional Testing:**  
	- Various types of functional testing are conducted to assess different aspects of the software:  
	- **Unit Testing:** Tests individual units or components in isolation to ensure their correctness.  
	- **Integration Testing:** Validates the interactions and interfaces between integrated components.  
	- **System Testing:** Evaluates the entire system's functionality as a whole.  
	- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involves end-users testing the software to ensure it meets their requirements.  
  
4. **Test Cases and Test Data:**  
- Test cases are developed to cover different scenarios, and appropriate test data is selected to execute these test cases.  
  
5. **Functional Requirements:**  
- Functional testing ensures that the software aligns with the specified functional requirements documented during the software development life cycle.  
  
6. **Black Box Testing:**  
- Functional testing is often conducted as a black-box testing approach, where the tester focuses on input and output without knowledge of the internal code structure.  
  
7. **Regression Testing:**  
- As the software evolves through development cycles, functional testing includes regression testing to ensure that new changes do not adversely affect existing functionalities.  
  
8. **Error Detection:**  
- Functional testing helps identify errors, bugs, or deviations from expected behavior. Testers report defects that are then addressed by the development team.  
  
9. **Automation:**  
- Functional testing can be performed manually or automated, depending on the complexity and frequency of testing. Automated testing tools are commonly used to execute repetitive test scenarios efficiently.  
  
10. **Validation of Business Logic:**  
- Functional testing validates that the business logic implemented in the software functions correctly and consistently.  
  
Functional testing is an integral part of the overall software testing process, providing assurance that the software not only meets its functional requirements but also delivers the intended features and capabilities to end-users. It ensures that the software behaves as expected, providing a reliable and user-friendly experience.
