Behavior Driven Development (BDD) extends the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD) by emphasizing writing scenarios from the end user's perspective, fostering collaboration between business stakeholders and developers.

BDD comprises two integral components:

1. **The Business Side:**
   - *Feature Files:* These files employ the Gherkin language to articulate scenarios in a syntax akin to English. Gherkin serves as a shared language, ensuring clarity and alignment across the entire team.

2. **The Implementation Side:**
   - Here, the focus is on translating the scenarios into automated application logic, implementing the necessary programming functionalities.

BDD encourages a collaborative approach to software development, promoting a shared understanding between technical and non-technical team members.

For more in-depth information on BDD, you can refer to the official documentation at [Cucumber - BDD](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/) and [Cucumber - Overview](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/).
