YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format commonly used for configuration files, data exchange, and storing structured data. It was designed to be easily readable by humans and easy to parse by machines.

it is used to agree on rules and standards between frontend and backend technologies and is considered an alternative to XML.

Here are some key features and characteristics of YAML:

1.  Human-readable: YAML uses indentation and simple syntax, making it easy for humans to read and write. It uses whitespace indentation to define the structure and hierarchy of data.
    
2.  Structure and data types: YAML supports various data types such as scalars (strings, numbers, booleans), lists (arrays), and maps (key-value pairs). It allows nesting of these data types to represent complex structures.
    
3.  Purpose: YAML allows comments to be included in the data using the '#' symbol. Comments can be used to provide additional information or annotate the configuration.
    
4.  Readability: YAML emphasizes readability by avoiding unnecessary symbols and characters. It uses colons (":") to separate keys from values and hyphens ("-") for list items.
    
5.  Inclusion of other files: YAML provides a feature called "anchors" and "aliases" that allow you to reuse parts of the data structure within the same file or across multiple files. This promotes modularity and reduces redundancy.
    
6.  Support for multiple programming languages: YAML has libraries and parsers available for various programming languages, making it easy to work with YAML data in different environments.
