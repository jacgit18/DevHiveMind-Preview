In the JavaScript ecosystem, especially for microservices architecture, there isn't a direct equivalent to Eureka, which is a service registry and discovery server commonly used in Java-based microservices with Spring Cloud.  
  
However, there are alternative solutions for service discovery and management in the JavaScript ecosystem:  
  
1. **Consul:**  
- Consul by HashiCorp is a service mesh solution that provides service discovery, health checking, and key-value storage. It supports multiple languages, including JavaScript, and is designed to work well in microservices architectures.  
  
2. **etcd:**  
- etcd is a distributed key-value store that can be used for service discovery. While it's not specifically designed for this purpose, it can be leveraged in microservices setups.  
  
3. **Zookeeper:**  
- Apache ZooKeeper is a distributed coordination service that can be used for service discovery among other things. It's a more general-purpose tool but can be employed in microservices architectures.  
  
4. **NATS (NATS.io):**  
- NATS is a lightweight and high-performance messaging system that can be used for communication between microservices. While not a dedicated service discovery tool, it facilitates communication in a distributed system.  
  
Remember, the choice of a service discovery solution may depend on various factors including the specific requirements of your microservices architecture, the level of support for your chosen programming languages, and the overall architecture of your system.
