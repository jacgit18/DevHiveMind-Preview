**(@) Prefix on NPM Packages**

The "(@)" prefix on NPM packages is a feature known as "scoped packages." Scoped packages allow NPM packages to be namespaced, providing a way to organize and differentiate packages. Every user and organization on NPM has their own scope, and they are the sole entities permitted to add packages within it.

The utility of scoped packages includes:

1. **Clarity for Official Packages**:
   - Scoped packages enable organizations to clearly distinguish official packages from others. For instance, if a package bears the scope "@angular," it signifies that it was published by the Angular core team.

2. **Scope-Based Uniqueness**:
   - Package names only need to be unique within the scope they are published in, not across the entire NPM registry. This means that the same package name can exist in different scopes without conflicts. For instance, "http" might already be taken in the main registry, but Angular can use "@angular/http" within its scope.


The reason that [scoped packages don't appear in public searches](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8244) is due to many of them being private packages created by organizations using NPM's paid services. NPM is cautious about making private content public and wants to ensure it complies with legal considerations.

## Running code

When running code, it's common to execute specific scripts within projects. For example, running "npm run test-setup" might be required regularly, especially when working on projects with ongoing database schema updates or during early development stages.
