It seems like you're referring to ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES), which is the official standard specification for JavaScript. JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript, and various versions of ECMAScript define the features and syntax that JavaScript engines should support.  
  
Here are a few key points related to ECMAScript and JavaScript:  
  
1. **ECMAScript Standardization:** ECMAScript is developed and maintained by Ecma International. The standard defines the scripting language specifications and is often implemented by various vendors in their JavaScript engines.  
  
2. **JavaScript as an Implementation:** JavaScript is the most well-known implementation of ECMAScript. When people refer to JavaScript, they are often referring to the language based on the ECMAScript specifications.  
  
3. **ECMAScript Versions:** Different versions of ECMAScript have been released over time, each introducing new features and improvements. For example, ES5, ES6 (also known as ECMAScript 2015), ES2016, and so on.
