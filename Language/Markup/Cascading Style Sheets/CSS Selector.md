CSS comprises a selector, which can be a tag, ID, class, or an advanced selector. Within the declaration block, various properties and values are assigned to the selected element within the HTML.


The CSS `element>element` selector is utilized to target elements with a specific parent. For instance:

```css
div > p {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  - This targets `<p>` elements that are direct children of `<div>` elements, setting their background color to yellow.

- **Select All:**
  - The `element>element` selector is specifically used to select elements with a defined parent. To select all instances of an element, you would use a simpler selector, such as just the element name (e.g., `div`).

- **Nested Class Access:**
	- For nested classes, you can chain selectors, such as `DOT.red DOT.green`, to access elements with the class `DOT.green` nested within an element with the class `DOT.red`.
	- DOT is for weird not render behavior with out it words would render weird for this section.
