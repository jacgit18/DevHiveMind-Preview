Kotlin is a modern, statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can be used for a variety of applications, including Android app development. Developed by JetBrains, Kotlin is designed to be concise, expressive, and interoperable with existing Java code. It aims to address some of the shortcomings of Java while providing features that make development more efficient and enjoyable.

Key features of Kotlin include:

1. **Conciseness:** Kotlin reduces boilerplate code, making it more concise and readable compared to Java.

2. **Null Safety:** Kotlin has built-in null safety features to help prevent null pointer exceptions, a common issue in many programming languages.

3. **Interoperability:** Kotlin is fully interoperable with Java, allowing developers to leverage existing Java libraries and frameworks seamlessly.

4. **Smart Casts:** Kotlin introduces smart casts, which automatically cast types based on certain conditions, reducing the need for explicit casting.

5. **Extension Functions:** Developers can add new functions to existing classes without modifying their source code, promoting a clean and modular design.

6. **Coroutines:** Kotlin provides built-in support for coroutines, allowing developers to write asynchronous code more concisely and efficiently.

7. **Data Classes:** Kotlin simplifies the creation of classes meant primarily for storing data by providing concise syntax for defining data classes.

8. **Type Inference:** Kotlin's type inference system allows developers to omit explicit type declarations in many cases, making the code more concise without sacrificing type safety.

Overall, Kotlin aims to be a pragmatic language that enhances developer productivity, offers a smooth transition from Java, and provides modern language features to meet the demands of contemporary software development.
