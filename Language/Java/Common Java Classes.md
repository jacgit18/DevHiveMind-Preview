In a Java codebase, there are several common Java classes that are often implemented or utilized by other classes. These classes provide specific functionalities or features that are commonly required in many applications. Here are some examples:

1. Serializable: The Serializable interface allows classes to be serialized, meaning they can be converted into a stream of bytes for storage or transmission. Implementing Serializable allows objects of that class to be easily saved to files, sent over networks, or stored in databases.

2. Comparable: The Comparable interface allows classes to define a natural ordering for their objects. By implementing Comparable, objects can be sorted and compared with each other using methods like compareTo().

3. Cloneable: The Cloneable interface indicates that a class supports object cloning. Implementing Cloneable allows objects of that class to be cloned using the clone() method.

4. Runnable: The Runnable interface is used for creating threads. Classes that implement Runnable can define the code to be executed by a thread when it is started.

5. ActionListener: The ActionListener interface is commonly implemented by classes that handle events generated by user actions, such as button clicks. It provides a method, actionPerformed(), which is invoked when the associated action occurs.

6. Observer: The Observer interface is part of the observer design pattern. Classes that implement Observer can register themselves as observers of an observable object and receive notifications when the observed object changes its state.

7. Iterator: The Iterator interface provides a way to iterate over the elements of a collection. Implementing Iterator allows classes to define custom iteration logic and provide methods like hasNext() and next() to retrieve elements.

8. Comparable: The Comparable interface allows classes to define a natural ordering for their objects. By implementing Comparable, objects can be sorted and compared with each other using methods like compareTo().

9. Map.Entry: The Map.Entry interface represents a key-value pair in a map. It is commonly used when iterating over a map's entries using methods like entrySet().

10. ActionListener: The ActionListener interface is commonly implemented by classes that handle events generated by user actions, such as button clicks. It provides a method, actionPerformed(), which is invoked when the associated action occurs.

These are just a few examples of common Java classes that are often implemented or utilized by other classes in a codebase. These classes provide specific functionalities and features that help in achieving common programming tasks and patterns.
