A website/App needs five things a Network, Security, Storage, Database, & Compute you can hire specialist & invest in technologies but Cloud makes all this cheaper & more efficient. The core services AWS provide are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">EC2</mark> for compute then for Databases there is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">RDS</mark> & <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">DynamoBD</mark> then you storage service <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">S3</mark> which can think of it being similar to a CDN. Then there is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">VPC</mark>  for networking & <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">IAM</mark> for security. When it comes to these core services you are only billed for what  you use.  

You can work with AWS through <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CloudShell</mark>, Programmatic with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">CLI</mark>,  & <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">SDK</mark>  

**Amazon Config is a service used to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of AWS resources. Amazon Config provides detailed histories of resource configs and helps Enterprise stay true to the compliance provided in their internal guidelines.

Aws can be used in three ways as a IAAS(infrastructure as a service) were AWS will manage the bottom four layers the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">virtualization, servers, storage and networking.</mark> In other words, the physical things in the data center. 

And you're responsible for things. On top of that, you install the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">operating system such as Windows or Linux, the middleware, runtime, data, and applications </mark>

The Second way is PAAS(Platform as a service) were AWS increases what it manages taking control of Operating System, Middleware, & Runtime. While you just deploy your applications and data on top of that. Basically, code and data are your responsibilities. This is done through Elastic Beanstalk 

Then there is  SAAS(Software as a service) where AWS handles everything
