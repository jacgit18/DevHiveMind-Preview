## How do I manage my PKM notes and what theme Iâ€™m using


Iâ€™ve been using Obsidian as my second brain for a year now. Iâ€™ve tried other note-taking apps along the way, because I love to check all trendy stuff, but no other gives me the same versatility and customization power as Obsidian. Obsidian checks all my requisites for PKM, tasks, projects, daily journalâ€¦

This article starts a series where Iâ€™m going to review, after 1 year of usage, my Obsidian configuration, plugins, and workflows.

## How do I organize my PKM notes?

I use both folders and tags to organize my knowledge notes. I know I could do it only with tags, but it doesnâ€™t feel right to me to put all notes in the same folder. Maybe itâ€™s the fear that Obsidian will disappear suddenly and I have all the notes in the same folder and need to organize them by folder again ðŸ˜µðŸ’«. Anyway, as I said, I have my knowledge notes organized by the main subjects of my sysadmin work, like Active Directory, Exchange, DNS, etc. But I also use tags because it allows me to set multiple subjects to a note. For each subject/folder, I have a MOC that lists all the notes with the subjectâ€™s tag, and all tasks and daily journal entries with that tag. This way I can see all actions related to a subject and when did they take place.

```

Then for each PKM note, I also include a similar code to show tasks and daily journal entries that have a backlink to that note. This way I can see when I used a specific knowledge note in a task or daily event.

## Note Capture

I use [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) to create almost everything in my vault. Letâ€™s look at the PKM note macro:

This `New Note`choice is composed by 2 separate macros. In the first macro, it asks for the subject, which is nothing but the folders inside the PKM root. For this, Iâ€™m using javascript code that I found online and adapted for my workflow:

```
module.exports = async (params) => {    const {quickAddApi: {inputPrompt}} = params;    const files = app.vault.getMarkdownFiles().filter(f => f.path.includes("01 PKM/") && f.name == f.parent.name +".md" && f.name != "01 PKM.md" )    const pickedFile = await params.quickAddApi.suggester(        (file) => file.basename,        files    )    await params.quickAddApi.executeChoice('AddNewNote', {Subject: pickedFile.basename})}
```

This will get all files inside `01 PKM`that have the same name as the parent folder (the MOCs). In other words, it will get all folders that have a folder note. The `AddnewNote`is the name of the QuickAdd choice to send the selected subject (the second macro). `Subject` is the name of the variable in the second macro.

## Highlight Notes

Some situations on my PKM workflow require note highlighting. For example, notes requiring review. Iâ€™m using Colorful Note Borders to set a border color base on a frontmatter value. In this case, notes with `status: review`will have an orange border.

In the next parts, Iâ€™m going to review my tasks, projects, and daily journal workflows. Iâ€™m also going to list all plugins that I have installed.
