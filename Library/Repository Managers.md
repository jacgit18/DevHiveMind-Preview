There are several alternative services and repositories to Maven Central that you can use for managing and hosting your Java project dependencies. Some popular ones include:  
  
1. **JFrog Artifactory**: Artifactory is a widely used artifact repository manager that supports Maven along with other package managers. It offers a free community edition and a more feature-rich enterprise version.  
  
2. **Sonatype Nexus**: Nexus Repository Manager is another popular option. It supports Maven, as well as other package formats like Docker, npm, and more. It has both free and paid versions available.  
  
3. **Bintray**: Bintray was a popular platform for hosting software packages, including Maven artifacts. However, as of May 1, 2021, Bintray and JCenter have been sunsetted by JFrog.  
  
4. **GitHub Packages**: If your code is hosted on GitHub, you can use GitHub Packages to host your Maven artifacts. It's tightly integrated with GitHub repositories and supports multiple package formats, including Maven.  
  
5. **Google Cloud Storage**: You can use cloud storage services like Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3 to host your Maven artifacts. This approach requires some additional setup and scripting but can be cost-effective.  
  
6. **JitPack**: JitPack is a unique service that allows you to build and distribute your GitHub and GitLab projects as Maven artifacts on-demand. It's convenient for small projects hosted on Git repositories.  
  
7. **Apache Archiva**: Archiva is an open-source repository manager that can be used as an alternative to central repositories. It's not as feature-rich as some of the others but can serve as a lightweight solution.  
  
8. **Local Repositories**: In some cases, you might opt to set up a local Maven repository on your own infrastructure using tools like Apache Maven's `install` or `deploy` goals. This is useful for managing your project's internal dependencies.  
  
The choice of which alternative service to use depends on your specific project needs, budget, and infrastructure preferences. Many organizations use a combination of these services to manage their dependencies effectively.

Consider replacing resource-intensive JavaScript libraries with smaller alternatives. ChromeDevTools' [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview#get-started) now recommends compact libraries, improving overall bundle size.
