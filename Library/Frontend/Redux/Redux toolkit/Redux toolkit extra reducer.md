## When cake is ordered

"When using the cake reducer, the cake count decrements by one. Surprisingly, the ice cream reducer responds to the same action, thanks to their shared 'cake_ordered' action type. In traditional Redux, each reducer can update only its designated portion of the app state. However, with shared action types, both reducers respond to the action.

In Redux Toolkit, the default behavior is different. Reducers from one createSlice will only respond to action types generated within that specific slice, not in other slices. This is where 'extraReducers' comes into play. It ensures that each reducer only reacts to the action types generated within its own createSlice. In essence, reducers from one createSlice will exclusively respond to action types generated by that particular slice. Two ways to implement this are demonstrated in the code."


```jsx
import { cakeActions } from '../cake/cakeSlice';
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = {
  numOfIcecreams: 10
};

const icecreamSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'icecream',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    ordered: state => {
      state.numOfIcecreams--;
    },
    restocked: (state, action) => {
      state.numOfIcecreams += action.payload;
    }
  },
  extraReducers: builder => {
    builder.addCase(cakeActions.ordered, state => {
      state.numOfIcecreams--;
    });
  }
});

export const { ordered, restocked } = icecreamSlice.actions;
export default icecreamSlice.reducer;
```
