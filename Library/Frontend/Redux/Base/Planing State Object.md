When managing state for network requests, especially when fetching data from a database, the state structure might commonly include:

```javascript
state = {
  loading: true,
  data: [],
  error: ''
};
```

Here:
- `loading` signifies the ongoing request,
- `data` holds the retrieved information, often structured as a list (e.g., a news feed of user posts),
- `error` is utilized for displaying any encountered errors.

Within the reducer, various cases would handle updates for `loading`, `data`, and `error` based on different stages of the network request. These cases would cover scenarios such as when new data is being loaded, when data is successfully fetched, and when errors occur during the process.
