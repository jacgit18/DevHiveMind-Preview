An alternative approach utilizing Hooks, particularly beneficial when working with Redux Toolkit in conjunction with react-redux for state management.

This code can be rendered directly in the App component, eliminating the need for 

`connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App)`

While the code structure differs, the core concept remains the same.
```JSX
import { buyCake } from '../redux';

function HooksCakeContainer() {
  const numOfCakes = useSelector(state => state.cake.numOfCakes);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Number of cakes - {numOfCakes} </h2>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(buyCake())}>Buy Cake</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HooksCakeContainer;
```
