### Lifecycle Methods Execution Order:

1. **`getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`**

   This method is invoked before every render, providing an opportunity to update the state based on changes in props. It's rarely used and generally considered less common in modern React applications.

2. **`shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`**

   This method is crucial for performance optimization. It receives the next props and state, allowing you to control whether the component should re-render. By default, components will re-render, but by returning `false` in this method, you can prevent unnecessary re-renders. Use this method to compare current and next prop/state values and decide whether a re-render is necessary, avoiding unnecessary network requests or state manipulations.

3. **`render()`**

   The `render` method is responsible for returning the virtual DOM representation of the component. It's a mandatory method in every React component and is where the UI structure is defined.

4. **`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`**

   This rarely used method is called before changes from the virtual DOM are applied to the actual DOM. It can be used to capture information from the DOM before it changes. The method returns `null` or a value that will be passed to the next method, `componentDidUpdate`.

5. **`componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`**

   This method is called after the render is finished in the re-render cycle. It's suitable for handling side effects, such as network requests, but it's essential to compare `prevProps` and `prevState` with the new props and state before making any requests.

### Execution Flow Example:

1. Class A goes through the lifecycle methods (`getDerivedStateFromProps`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `render`).
2. Renders another component from Class B.
3. Class B goes through its lifecycle methods.
4. Calls `getDerivedStateFromProps`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `render`, and then `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`.
5. Returns to Class A and completes its `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`.
6. Finally, `componentDidUpdate` in Class B is executed, waiting for the snapshot of Class A to finish, and then the initial `componentDidUpdate` of Class A is called.

In these update methods (`shouldComponentUpdate`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`, and `componentDidUpdate`), comparisons between previous and current props or state are essential for making informed decisions about re-rendering and handling side effects appropriately.

## Code Example

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class LifecycleExample extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    console.log('getDerivedStateFromProps');
    // Update state based on props if needed
    return null; // Returning null means no state update
  }

  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log('shouldComponentUpdate');
    // Decide whether to re-render based on conditions
    return nextState.count !== this.state.count;
  }

  render() {
    console.log('render');
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    console.log('getSnapshotBeforeUpdate');
    // Capture information before changes are applied to the DOM
    return null; // Returning null or a value
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {
    console.log('componentDidUpdate');
    // Handle side effects or post-render actions
  }

  handleIncrement = () => {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({
      count: prevState.count + 1,
    }));
  };

  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log('componentWillUnmount');
    // Cleanup operations before unmounting
  }
}

export default LifecycleExample;
```

In this example, the component has the common lifecycle methods: `getDerivedStateFromProps`, `shouldComponentUpdate`, `render`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. The console logs within each method demonstrate the order of execution during the component's lifecycle.

Remember that `getDerivedStateFromProps` and `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` are rarely used in practice and are included here for demonstration purposes. `shouldComponentUpdate` is used to optimize rendering, and `componentDidUpdate` is commonly utilized for side effects after rendering.
