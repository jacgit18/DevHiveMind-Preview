Implementing a DNS resolver in JavaScript involves making DNS queries and handling responses. You can use the `dns` module in [[Node.js]] for this purpose. If you have a [[Load Balancer]], it might handle DNS resolution itself, and you can connect to the load balancer's IP address.  
  
Here's a simple example using Node.js `dns` module:  
  
```javascript  
const dns = require('dns');  
  
const domain = 'example.com';  
  
dns.resolve4(domain, (err, addresses) => {  
if (err) {  
console.error(err);  
return;  
}  
console.log(`IP addresses for ${domain}: ${addresses}`);  
});  
```  
  
If you're using a load balancer, you'd typically connect to its IP or domain directly. The load balancer then distributes incoming requests to the backend servers.  
  
Keep in mind that browser-based JavaScript (client-side) is limited in making direct DNS queries due to security reasons. DNS resolution is usually handled by the browser or the underlying operating system. In a server-side environment (like Node.js), you have more flexibility.



Load balancers like HAProxy and NGINX don't typically include a built-in DNS resolver themselves. They rely on the underlying operating system's DNS resolution capabilities. However, these load balancers are designed to work seamlessly with DNS.  
  
In a typical setup, you configure your load balancer with the IP addresses or hostnames of your backend servers. DNS resolution for these backend servers is performed by the system running the load balancer. If you need dynamic updates or have changing backend server addresses, you may need an external mechanism to update the load balancer's configuration.  
  
Some cloud-based load balancers, like those provided by AWS or Google Cloud, integrate with their respective DNS services for dynamic backend updates. Always refer to the specific documentation of the load balancer you're using for accurate information regarding its capabilities and configuration.
