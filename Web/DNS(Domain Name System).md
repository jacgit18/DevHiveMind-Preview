DNS, or Domain Name System, is a decentralized system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses used by computers to identify each other on a network. Essentially, DNS acts as a directory service for the internet, allowing users to access websites and other online resources using easily memorable names instead of numerical IP addresses.


## Recursive Resolver
A DNS recursive resolver is a crucial component in the DNS infrastructure. Its primary function is to fetch information on behalf of a client by navigating through the hierarchical structure of the DNS.

When a user makes a request to access a website (for example, www.example.com), their device queries a DNS recursive resolver. The resolver, in turn, interacts with authoritative DNS servers to obtain the IP address associated with the requested domain. This involves a recursive process where the resolver iteratively queries different DNS servers until it reaches the authoritative server that holds the specific IP information for the domain.

Regarding a load balancer, DNS doesn't directly interact with load balancers. However, the IP addresses returned by the DNS resolver could point to multiple servers managed by a load balancer. The load balancer then distributes incoming network traffic across these servers, ensuring optimal resource utilization and reliability.

In summary, the DNS recursive resolver helps translate domain names into [[IP Address Structure |IP addresses]], and the IP addresses obtained from this process may be associated with servers managed by a load balancer for efficient distribution of incoming requests.
