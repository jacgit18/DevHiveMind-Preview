## **GET Method: Retrieving Resources**

The GET method is designed for requesting a representation of a specific resource, solely for data retrieval.

- **Read (Retrieve):** Retrieves the most recent value or null if it doesn't exist.

- **When to Use GET:**
  - The Web infrastructure relies on the idempotent and safe nature of GET, allowing clients to repeat requests without altering data (Read-Only) and enabling caches to serve cached representations without contacting the origin server.
  - GET has no body but includes parameters.
  - Misuse of GET for unsafe operations, like bookmarking, adding items to a cart, sending messages, or deleting notes, can have severe consequences depending on the application.

- **Precautions for Unsafe Operations:**
  - Make the response non-cacheable by adding a `Cache-Control: no-cache` header.
  - Ensure any side effects are benign and do not alter critical data.
  - Implement the server so that these operations are repeatable (idempotent).

While these precautions mitigate errors for some operations, it's best to avoid abusing GET and use appropriate methods for actions that modify data.
