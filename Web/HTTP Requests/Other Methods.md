## **CONNECT Method: Two-Way Communication**

The CONNECT method initiates two-way communications with the requested resource and can establish a tunnel. For instance, it is commonly used to access SSL-secured websites (HTTPS). In this scenario, the client requests an HTTP Proxy server to tunnel the TCP connection to the intended destination. The server then establishes the connection on behalf of the client, maintaining proxying of the TCP stream between the client and the server.

## **OPTIONS Method: Communication Options Inquiry**

The OPTIONS method requests permitted communication options for a specified URL or server. Clients can specify a URL with this method or use an asterisk (\*) to encompass the entire server. Sending OPTIONS with an API URL provides information on all allowed functionalities, serving as a useful tool in the absence of documentation.

## **TRACE Method: Message Loop-Back Test**

The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource, offering a valuable debugging mechanism for analyzing the communication path.
