SEO, or search engine optimization, is the process of enhancing your website's visibility on search engines like Google and Bing. Improved visibility increases the likelihood of attracting potential customers. Search engines employ bots to crawl and index web pages, organizing them like a vast library. Algorithms analyze these indexed pages, considering various factors to determine their order in search results. Our SEO success factors represent aspects of user experience, helping search bots estimate a website's relevance to user queries.

Unlike paid search ads, organic search rankings can't be bought, requiring dedicated effort from SEO experts. Our Periodic Table of SEO Factors categorizes elements into six main groups, assigning weights based on their importance. Content quality, keyword research, crawlability, and speed are key considerations.

The updated SEO Periodic Table includes a Toxins section, highlighting practices that undermine SEO best practices. Additionally, the Niches section delves into success factors for Local SEO, News/Publishing, and Ecommerce SEO, offering insights tailored to specific areas.

While JavaScript web frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular are popular for app development, they may not be optimal for SEO. Google tends to favor frameworks like Django or PHP for better search rankings.
