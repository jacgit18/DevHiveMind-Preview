![[Hypertext vs Hypermedia.png]]

**What is Hypermedia?**
Hypermedia is an evolved form of hypertext that incorporates diverse media types, including text, graphics, audio, and video sequences. Unlike hypertext, hypermedia isn't limited to textual elements; it expands the concept by introducing clickable links within web pages, creating a network of interconnected, non-linear information. This approach allows users to access and interact with multimedia content, enhancing their overall experience. Image links, commonly connected to other web pages, represent a prevalent form of hypermedia. Its applications span diverse fields, from problem-solving and qualitative research to electronic learning and advanced educational tools.

**Difference between Hypertext and Hypermedia**
- **Definition:** Hypertext involves text containing links that transfer users to other text chunks through mouse clicks or keypresses. Hypermedia extends the hypertext concept but includes various media elements like audio, images, video, and graphics.

- **Representation:** Hypertext forms an interconnected network of documents with links between them, featuring both static and dynamic content. Hypermedia goes beyond text, incorporating a wide range of multimedia elements such as audio, video, and graphics.

- **Technology:** Hypertext, while widely associated with the World Wide Web, has roots in earlier technologies. It relies on human-computer interaction through hyperlinks. Hypermedia, a more recent development, utilizes non-linear multimedia elements to enhance overall experiences, particularly in education.

- **Applications:** Hypertext extends beyond internet-based linking and can be applied to various applications, including electronic studying, literary exploration, and qualitative research. Hypermedia, exemplified by the World Wide Web, defines a network of interconnected documents enriched by extensive cross-referencing tools like hypertext.
