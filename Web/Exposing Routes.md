Exposing routes in a monolithic API built with TypeScript typically involves using a web framework, such as Express.js, to define routes and handle HTTP requests. Here's a simplified process of exposing routes in a TypeScript monolith API using Express.js as an example:

1. **Set Up Your Project:**
   Create a new TypeScript project and set up your development environment. Make sure to install the necessary dependencies, including Express, TypeScript, and any other libraries you plan to use.

2. **Create an Express Application:**
   Initialize an Express application in your TypeScript code. You can do this by creating an instance of `express.Application`.

```typescript
import express from 'express';
const app = express();
```

3. **Define Routes:**
   Define the routes for your API by specifying HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and associated route paths. You can use Express route handlers to define the logic for each route.

```typescript
app.get('/api/resource', (req, res) => {
  // Handle GET request logic
  res.json({ message: 'GET request received' });
});

app.post('/api/resource', (req, res) => {
  // Handle POST request logic
  res.json({ message: 'POST request received' });
});
```

4. **Middleware:**
   You can use middleware functions to perform tasks such as request parsing, authentication, and error handling. Middleware functions can be applied globally or to specific routes.

```typescript
// Example middleware for request body parsing
app.use(express.json());
```

5. **Start the Server:**
   Start the Express server and specify the port on which it should listen for incoming requests.

```typescript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

6. **Compile and Run:**
   Compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler, and then run your application with Node.js.

7. **Testing:**
   Use tools like Postman or cURL to test your API routes by making HTTP requests to the specified routes.

This is a basic overview of how to expose routes in a monolithic API using TypeScript and Express.js. You can expand on this by adding database interactions, authentication, and more as needed for your specific application.

## Guarded Routes

The opposite of exposing an API endpoint is "hiding" or "restricting" an API endpoint. In the context of API design and development, exposing an endpoint means making it publicly accessible for clients to interact with, typically over the internet.

Conversely, hiding or restricting an API endpoint involves making it private or inaccessible to most clients. This can be achieved through various means, such as:

1. **Authentication and Authorization:** Requiring users to authenticate and have proper authorization (permissions) before they can access specific API endpoints.

2. **API Keys:** Requiring the use of API keys or tokens to access certain endpoints, which can be controlled and restricted.

3. **Firewalls and IP Whitelisting:** Implementing network-level security measures to restrict access to API endpoints based on IP addresses.

4. **Rate Limiting:** Limiting the number of requests that can be made to an endpoint within a given time frame to prevent abuse.

5. **Endpoint Documentation:** Not documenting or sharing information about an endpoint, making it harder for external clients to discover and use it.

6. **Internal Use Only:** Designing certain endpoints for internal use within the application and not exposing them to external clients.

The decision to expose or restrict API endpoints depends on the security, privacy, and business requirements of the application. It's essential to balance the need for openness and accessibility with the need to protect sensitive data and functionality.


Hiding an endpoint in an API often involves implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms. Below is a simplified example in Node.js using Express.js to restrict access to an endpoint by requiring authentication:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Simulated user data (you would typically use a database)
const users = [
  { username: 'user1', password: 'password1' },
  { username: 'user2', password: 'password2' },
];

// Middleware for basic authentication
app.use(express.json());

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  // Check if valid username and password are provided
  const validUser = users.find((user) => user.username === username && user.password === password);

  if (validUser) {
    // User is authenticated, continue to the next middleware
    next();
  } else {
    // Authentication failed, send a 401 Unauthorized response
    res.status(401).json({ message: 'Authentication failed' });
  }
});

// The hidden endpoint that requires authentication
app.get('/hidden-endpoint', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'This is a hidden endpoint' });
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

In this example, the `/hidden-endpoint` is "hidden" behind authentication. To access this endpoint, clients must provide a valid username and password in the request body. If the provided credentials are not valid, the server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status.

Please note that this is a basic example, and in a real-world application, you would typically use more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth, for better security.
